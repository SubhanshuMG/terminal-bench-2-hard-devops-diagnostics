  "analysis": "Great! The validator is now working and has produced a report. I can see that it correctly identified the services: auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, and notification-service are healthy, while worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 503 as expected).

Let me check the generated report to verify it matches the expected schema.",
