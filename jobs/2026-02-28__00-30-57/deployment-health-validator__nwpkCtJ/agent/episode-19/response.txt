  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. Let me summarize what was accomplished:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed Bug #1: Changed config['services'] to config['deployment']['services'] to correctly access the manifest\n2. ✅ Fixed Bug #2: Changed hardcoded '/health' to use the configured health_endpoint (e.g., /ping for cache-service, /status for worker-service)\n3. ✅ Fixed Bug #3: Corrected the graph edge direction in compute_startup_order so dependencies point correctly\n4. ✅ Fixed Bug #4: Updated weight_map to use proper weights (high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1) for readiness score calculation\n5. ✅ Fixed Bug #5: Modified determine_status to only check high-criticality services for critical status\n\nThe validator now:\n- Correctly reads all 5 services from the manifest\n- Uses the proper health endpoints (confirmed with curl tests)\n- Generates correct startup order based on dependencies\n- Calculates readiness score correctly (0.9 as expected)\n- Determines overall_status as 'degraded' (correct since score is 0.9 and all high-criticality services are healthy)\n- Produces a valid JSON report at /app/deployment_report.json with all required fields\n\nThe report shows:\n- overall_status: 'degraded' ✓\n- readiness_score: 0.9 ✓\n- critical_services_healthy: true ✓\n- All service statuses are correct\n- Startup order is topologically correct",
