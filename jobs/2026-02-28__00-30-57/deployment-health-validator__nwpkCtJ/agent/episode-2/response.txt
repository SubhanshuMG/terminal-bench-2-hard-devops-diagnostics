I can see the deployment manifest with 5 services: auth-service (high criticality, port 8081), api-gateway (high criticality, port 8082), cache-service (medium criticality, port 8083), worker-service (low criticality, port 8084), and notification-service (low criticality, port 8085). Each has different health endpoints and dependencies. Now I need to check if the mock services are running and then examine the broken validator.py.",
