  "analysis": "Perfect! I can see exactly what's broken in the validator.py. There are 5 bugs clearly identified in the comments: 1) Wrong key to access services from manifest, 2) Hardcoded '/health' endpoint instead of using configured health_endpoint, 3) Reversed edge direction in dependency graph, 4) All criticality levels get weight 1 instead of proper weights, and 5) Checks ALL services instead of only high-criticality ones for critical status. I need to fix these bugs.",
  "plan": "I'll fix each of the 5 bugs one by one: 1) Fix the manifest access to use ['deployment']['services'], 2) Use the configured health_endpoint instead of hardcoded '/health', 3) Fix the graph edge direction, 4) Use proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 5) Only check high-criticality services for critical status.",
