  "plan": "I'll fix each bug by editing the validator.py file: 1) Fix the load_services function to use config['deployment']['services'], 2) Fix check_health to use the configured health_endpoint, 3) Fix the graph edge direction in compute_startup_order, 4) Fix the weight_map in compute_readiness_score, 5) Fix determine_status to only check high-criticality services.",
