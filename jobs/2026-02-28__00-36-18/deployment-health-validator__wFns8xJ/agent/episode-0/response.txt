I need to analyze the current situation and understand the deployment health validation system. Let me start by examining the existing files to understand what needs to be fixed.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to examine the deployment health validation system. There are three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml (defines services and dependencies), mock_services.py (simulates the services), and validator.py (the broken script that needs fixing). I need to first understand the current state of these files and the mock services.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of the /app directory to confirm the files exist. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service definitions, check if the mock services are running, and finally look at the broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
