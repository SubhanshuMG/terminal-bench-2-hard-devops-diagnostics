  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py script that need to be fixed:\n\n1. In `check_health()` function: it's hardcoded to use `/health` endpoint but the manifest shows different endpoints (e.g., cache-service uses `/ping`, worker-service uses `/status`)\n\n2. In `compute_readiness_score()` function: the weight_map has wrong values - all are set to 1, but according to the specs it should be high=3, medium=2, low=1\n\n3. In `determine_status()` function: the critical_ok logic is wrong - it's checking all services instead of just high-criticality services\n\n4. In `compute_startup_order()` function: the dependency graph is built backwards - it's adding dependencies as if they depend on the service rather than the service depending on them\n\nLet me run the current broken version first to see what output it produces, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll run the current validator to see what it produces, then fix the identified issues one by one: fix the health endpoint URLs, fix the weight mapping, fix the critical services check, and fix the dependency graph construction.",
