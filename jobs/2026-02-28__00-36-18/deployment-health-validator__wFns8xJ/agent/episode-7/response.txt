  "analysis": "There's a KeyError because the YAML structure shows the services are under `deployment.services` not just `services`. Looking back at the manifest, the structure is:\n\ndeployment:\n  name: \"production-stack\"\n  services:\n    - ...\n\nSo the `load_services()` function needs to be fixed to access `config['deployment']['services']` instead of just `config['services']`. Let me fix this and the other issues I identified.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py script with the following corrections:\n1. Fix the YAML path in load_services() to use config['deployment']['services']\n2. Fix check_health() to use the correct health endpoint from the manifest\n3. Fix the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score()\n4. Fix the critical services check in determine_status()\n5. Fix the dependency graph construction in compute_startup_order()",
