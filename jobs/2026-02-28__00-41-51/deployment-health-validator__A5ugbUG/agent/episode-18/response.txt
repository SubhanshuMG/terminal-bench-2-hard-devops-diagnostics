  "analysis": "The validator is working better now, but there's still an issue. The overall status shows 'critical' but according to the rules, it should show 'degraded' since all high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy, and the readiness score is 0.9 (which is >= 0.70). The 'critical' status should only be when high-criticality services are unhealthy. Let me check the deployment report and see what needs to be fixed.",
