  "analysis": "Now I can see the issues with the validator.py script. There are several problems:\n\n1. **Health endpoint bug**: The `check_health` function hardcodes `/health` but the manifest shows different endpoints (e.g., cache-service uses `/ping`, worker-service uses `/status`)\n2. **Weight mapping bug**: The `compute_readiness_score` function has all criticality weights set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. **Dependency direction bug**: The `compute_startup_order` function has the dependency direction reversed - it should make dependencies start BEFORE the services that depend on them\n4. **Critical services check bug**: The `determine_status` function checks ALL services instead of only HIGH-criticality services\n\nLet me run the current broken version first to see the output, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll run the current broken validator to see what it produces, then fix the 4 main bugs I identified: health endpoint mapping, correct weight mapping, correct dependency direction, and proper critical services check.",
