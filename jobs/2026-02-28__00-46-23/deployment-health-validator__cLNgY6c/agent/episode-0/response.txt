I need to analyze the current situation and understand what's broken in the validator script. Let me start by examining the files to understand the structure and identify the issues.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to examine the deployment manifest, validator script, and understand the mock services that are running. The validator script is broken and I need to fix it to produce the correct deployment report.",
  "plan": "First, I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. Then I'll look at the validator.py script to see what's broken. I'll also verify the mock services are running.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
