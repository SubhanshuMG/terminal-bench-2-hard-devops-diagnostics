  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. It shows that 4 out of 5 services are healthy, with worker-service returning HTTP 503 (unhealthy) as expected from the mock_services.py comments. The readiness score is 0.9 (90%) and the overall status is 'degraded', which is correct since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is below 0.95. Let me check the generated report to verify it matches the expected schema.",
