All required fields are present: deployment_name, overall_status ('degraded'), readiness_score (0.9), service_statuses with correct structure, startup_order with proper topological sorting, critical_services_healthy (true), and timestamp. The validator is now working correctly - it properly checks health endpoints from the manifest, uses correct criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), correctly computes the startup order, and accurately determines the overall status based on the rules.",
