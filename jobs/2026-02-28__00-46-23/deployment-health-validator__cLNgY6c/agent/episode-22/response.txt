  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the validator.py script. The key bugs that were corrected are: 1) Fixed the health endpoint check to use the correct endpoint from the manifest (was hardcoded to '/health'), 2) Fixed the weight mapping to use correct criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1 instead of all 1), 3) The topological sort was already correctly implemented, 4) Fixed the critical services check to only consider high-criticality services. The validator now correctly generates a deployment report with the expected schema, showing a degraded status with 0.9 readiness score, which is correct given that worker-service (low criticality) is unhealthy but all high-criticality services are healthy.",
  "plan": "The task is complete. The validator is now working correctly and producing the expected deployment report with all required fields properly populated according to the specifications.",
