  "analysis": "I've examined the validator.py script and can identify several critical bugs that need to be fixed: 1) The check_health function is hardcoded to use '/health' endpoint instead of the actual endpoint from the manifest, 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The startup order algorithm has the dependency direction reversed - it's adding dependencies as if they depend on the service rather than the service depending on them, 4) The critical_ok check in determine_status is checking all services instead of only high-criticality services.",
  "plan": "I need to fix these bugs in the validator.py script. I'll modify the check_health function to use the correct health endpoint, fix the weight_map to use correct criticality weights, fix the topological sort algorithm to handle dependencies correctly, and fix the critical services check to only consider high-criticality services.",
