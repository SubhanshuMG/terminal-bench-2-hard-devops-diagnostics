  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is:\n\n1. **Loading wrong services**: It's only loading the legacy 'metrics-collector' from the top-level services, not the deployment.services\n2. **Using wrong health endpoint**: It's trying to access /health for metrics-collector instead of /metrics\n3. **Readiness score is 0.0**: Due to incorrect weight mapping (all weights are 1)\n4. **Only checking one service**: It's not seeing the actual 5 deployment services\n\nNow I need to fix these issues systematically.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by addressing each issue: 1) Fix load_services() to use deployment.services, 2) Fix check_health() to use the correct health_endpoint, 3) Fix weight mapping in compute_readiness_score(), 4) Fix the topological sort direction, 5) Fix critical services check in determine_status().",
