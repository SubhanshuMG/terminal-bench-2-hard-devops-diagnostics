  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema. Let me verify the key points:\n\n✅ **deployment_name**: \"production-stack\" (correct)\n✅ **overall_status**: \"degraded\" (correct - all high-criticality services healthy but score < 0.95)\n✅ **readiness_score**: 0.9 (correct calculation: (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9)\n✅ **service_statuses**: All 5 services with correct status, http_status, and criticality\n✅ **startup_order**: Correct topological sort\n✅ **critical_services_healthy**: true (both high-criticality services auth-service and api-gateway are healthy)\n✅ **timestamp**: Proper ISO format\n\nThe validator is now working correctly! Let me do one final test to make sure it handles edge cases properly.",
