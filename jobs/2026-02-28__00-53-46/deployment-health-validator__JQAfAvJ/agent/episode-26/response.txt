  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The deployment health validator has been successfully fixed and is working correctly:\n\n✅ **Fixed manifest loading**: Now correctly loads services from deployment.services instead of legacy services\n✅ **Fixed health endpoints**: Now uses the correct health_endpoint from each service definition (/health, /ping, /status)\n✅ **Fixed readiness score calculation**: Now uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n✅ **Fixed topological sort**: Dependencies now correctly appear before their dependents in startup_order\n✅ **Fixed critical services check**: Now only checks HIGH criticality services for critical_ok\n✅ **Correct report generation**: Generates valid JSON report with all required fields matching the expected schema\n✅ **Correct status determination**: Shows 'degraded' status which is correct given the current service health (all high-criticality services healthy, but readiness_score = 0.9 < 0.95)\n\nThe validator now correctly identifies all 5 services, checks their health status, calculates the weighted readiness score, determines the proper startup order, and generates the deployment report as required.",
