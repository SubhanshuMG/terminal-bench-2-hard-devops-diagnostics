  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py code:\n\n1. **Wrong manifest loading**: The `load_services()` function returns `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring services, not the authoritative `deployment.services`.\n\n2. **Wrong health endpoint**: The `check_health()` function hardcodes `/health` but the manifest shows different endpoints like `/ping` and `/status`.\n\n3. **Incorrect weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels are mapped to weight 1, but they should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. **Topological sort direction**: The `compute_startup_order()` function has the graph edges reversed - dependencies should come BEFORE their dependents, but the current code puts dependents before dependencies.\n\n5. **Critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking ALL services instead of just HIGH criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the current services to see their health status, then fix the validator.",
