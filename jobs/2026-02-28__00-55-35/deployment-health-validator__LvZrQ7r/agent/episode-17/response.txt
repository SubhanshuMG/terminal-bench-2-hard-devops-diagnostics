  "analysis": "Perfect! The readiness score calculation is correct at 0.9 (90%). The validator is now working properly and producing the correct deployment report. Let me also verify that the overall_status logic is correct:\n\n- All high-criticality services (auth-service, api-gateway) are healthy ✓\n- Readiness score is 0.9 which is < 0.95 ✓\n- Therefore overall_status should be 'degraded' ✓\n\nThe validator is now fixed and working correctly! Let me run it one more time to confirm everything is working as expected.",
