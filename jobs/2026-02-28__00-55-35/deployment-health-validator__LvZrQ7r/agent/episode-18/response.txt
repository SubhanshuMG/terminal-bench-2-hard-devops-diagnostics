  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working perfectly and consistently. All the bugs have been fixed:\n\n✅ **Fixed load_services()** - Now reads from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy services\n✅ **Fixed check_health()** - Now uses service['health_endpoint'] instead of hardcoded '/health'\n✅ **Fixed compute_readiness_score()** - Now uses correct weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1\n✅ **Fixed compute_startup_order()** - Corrected topological sort direction so dependencies start before dependents\n✅ **Fixed determine_status()** - Now correctly checks only high-criticality services for critical_ok\n\nThe validator is now producing the correct deployment report with:\n- All 5 services properly checked\n- Correct readiness score of 0.9 (90%)\n- Correct overall status of 'degraded'\n- Proper startup order based on dependencies\n- All required fields in the JSON report schema",
