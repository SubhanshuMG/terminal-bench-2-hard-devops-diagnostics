  "analysis": "Perfect! Everything is working correctly. The validator has been successfully debugged and fixed:\n\n✅ **All bugs fixed**: The validator now correctly reads deployment services, uses proper health endpoints, applies correct weights, performs correct topological sort, and checks only high-criticality services for critical status.\n\n✅ **Report schema compliance**: The JSON report has all required fields with correct data types and values.\n\n✅ **Topological sort correctness**: The startup order correctly places dependencies before dependents.\n\n✅ **Business logic**: The overall_status is 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but the readiness score (0.9) is < 0.95.\n\n✅ **Readiness score calculation**: Correctly weighted (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9.\n\nThe deployment health validator is now working as intended and produces the correct deployment_report.json file.",
