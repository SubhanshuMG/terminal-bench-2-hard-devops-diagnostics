  "analysis": "I have successfully debugged and fixed the deployment health validator. All critical bugs have been resolved:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to read from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy monitoring services\n2. ✅ Fixed check_health() to use service['health_endpoint'] instead of hardcoded '/health'\n3. ✅ Fixed compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ Fixed compute_startup_order() to correctly implement topological sort with proper dependency direction\n5. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_ok determination\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Checks all 5 deployment services (not just the legacy metrics-collector)\n- Uses the correct health endpoints (/health, /ping, /status) as defined in the manifest\n- Calculates the readiness score with proper weighted values\n- Generates the correct topological startup order\n- Produces the expected JSON report schema with all required fields\n\nThe deployment_report.json file now contains the correct structure with proper overall_status ('degraded'), readiness_score (0.9), service_statuses for all 5 services, correct startup_order, and all other required fields.",
