  "analysis": "Perfect! The current output confirms all the bugs I identified:\n\n1. It's only checking `metrics-collector` (the legacy service) instead of the 5 deployment services\n2. The readiness score is 0.0 because the weight_map sets all weights to 1\n3. It's showing as critical because it's not actually checking the high-criticality services\n\nNow I need to fix the validator.py file. I'll make a backup first, then fix each issue systematically.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by addressing all the bugs:\n1. Fix the load_services() function to read from deployment.services\n2. Fix check_health() to use the correct health endpoint from the service definition\n3. Fix the weight_map in compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. Fix the topological sort direction in compute_startup_order()\n5. Fix determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_ok",
