  "analysis": "Great! The fixed validator.py file has been created successfully. Now let me test it to see if all the bugs have been resolved. The fixed version should:\n1. Load the correct deployment services (not the legacy ones)\n2. Use the correct health endpoints from the manifest\n3. Apply correct weights for readiness scoring (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. Fix the topological sort direction\n5. Correctly check only high-criticality services for critical_ok",
  "plan": "I'll run the fixed validator to see if it works correctly now. If it does, we should see all 5 services being checked with their correct health endpoints, proper readiness scoring, and correct overall status determination.",
