All the key requirements are met:\n\n1. ✅ All 5 services are included with correct status, HTTP status, and criticality\n2. ✅ Overall status is 'degraded' (high-criticality services are healthy, but readiness score is 0.9 < 0.95)\n3. ✅ Readiness score is 0.9 (calculated correctly: (3*2 + 2*1 + 1*1)/(3*2 + 2 + 1*2) = 9/10 = 0.9)\n4. ✅ Startup order is correct with dependencies properly ordered\n5. ✅ critical_services_healthy is true (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n6. ✅ Timestamp is in ISO format\n7. ✅ Report is written to /app/deployment_report.json as required\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and the deployment pipeline should function properly.",
