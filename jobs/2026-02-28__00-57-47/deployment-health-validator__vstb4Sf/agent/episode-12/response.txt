  "analysis": "The validator is working perfectly and consistently. All the key issues have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to use the authoritative deployment.services section instead of legacy services\n2. ✅ Fixed check_health() to use the correct health endpoints from the manifest (/ping for cache-service, /status for worker-service)\n3. ✅ Fixed compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1\n4. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for the critical_services_healthy flag\n5. ✅ Fixed compute_startup_order() to properly handle dependencies in the correct direction\n\nThe output shows all 5 services being checked with correct endpoints, the readiness score is properly calculated at 0.9 (4 healthy services with weights: 3+3+2+1 = 9 out of total possible 10), overall status is 'degraded' as expected (high-criticality services healthy but score < 0.95), and the report follows the exact JSON schema specified in the requirements.",
