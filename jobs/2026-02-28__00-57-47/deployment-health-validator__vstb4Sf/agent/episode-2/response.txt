  "analysis": "Perfect! I can see the deployment manifest clearly defines 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. The services are: auth-service (port 8081, /health, high), api-gateway (port 8082, /health, high), cache-service (port 8083, /ping, medium), worker-service (port 8084, /status, low), and notification-service (port 8085, /health, low). Now let me check if the mock services are running by testing one of them.",
