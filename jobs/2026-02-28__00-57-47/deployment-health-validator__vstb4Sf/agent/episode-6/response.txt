  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py script that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **load_services()**: It's using the wrong manifest path - it's loading from the top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services' which is the authoritative source.\n\n2. **check_health()**: It's hardcoded to use '/health' endpoint, but the manifest shows different endpoints like '/ping' and '/status' for some services.\n\n3. **compute_readiness_score()**: The weight_map has all criticalities set to 1, but according to the task requirements, it should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. **determine_status()**: It's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality ones for the critical_ok check.\n\n5. **compute_startup_order()**: The topological sort logic is backwards - it's adding dependencies to the service's graph instead of the other way around.\n\nLet me run the current broken version first to see what happens, then fix these issues.",
