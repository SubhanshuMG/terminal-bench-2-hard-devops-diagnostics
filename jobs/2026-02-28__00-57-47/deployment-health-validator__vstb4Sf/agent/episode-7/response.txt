  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only finding the 'metrics-collector' from the legacy monitoring registry instead of the actual 5 services from the deployment.services section. The health check failed because it used the wrong endpoint and the readiness score is 0.0 due to the incorrect weight mapping. Let me fix these issues systematically.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py script by addressing each issue: 1) Use the correct manifest path (deployment.services), 2) Use the correct health endpoints from the manifest, 3) Fix the weight mapping for readiness score calculation, 4) Fix the critical services check, and 5) Fix the topological sort logic.",
