  "analysis": "Let me verify one more time that the generated report matches the exact schema requirements. I need to double-check the startup_order logic and ensure it's correct according to the dependency requirements. Looking at the current output, the startup order shows 'notification-service -> worker-service -> api-gateway -> auth-service -> cache-service', but this seems backwards - dependencies should come before their dependents, not after.",
