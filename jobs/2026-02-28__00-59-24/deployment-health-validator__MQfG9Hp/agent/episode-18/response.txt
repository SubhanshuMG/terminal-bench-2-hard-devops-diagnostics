Now the startup order is correct:\n\n1. auth-service (no dependencies)\n2. cache-service (no dependencies) \n3. api-gateway (depends on auth-service and cache-service)\n4. worker-service (depends on api-gateway and cache-service)\n5. notification-service (depends on worker-service)\n\nThis is the correct topological order where dependencies are started before the services that depend on them.
