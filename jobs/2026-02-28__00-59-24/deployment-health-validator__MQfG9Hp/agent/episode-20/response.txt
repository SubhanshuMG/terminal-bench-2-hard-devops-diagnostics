  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed all the issues in the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Fixed manifest loading**: Now correctly loads services from `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` instead of the legacy monitoring registry\n2. **Fixed health endpoint usage**: Now uses the correct health endpoint from each service definition instead of hardcoding '/health'\n3. **Fixed readiness score calculation**: Now uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) instead of all weights being 1\n4. **Fixed critical services check**: Now correctly checks only high-criticality services for the critical_ok determination\n5. **Fixed topological sort**: Now correctly orders services so dependencies come before their dependents\n\nThe validator is now producing correct deployment reports with:\n- Proper overall_status calculation based on the defined rules\n- Correct readiness_score calculation using weighted averages\n- Correct startup_order with proper topological sorting\n- All required fields in the expected JSON schema format\n\nThe final report shows 'degraded' status with 0.9 readiness score, which is correct since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is below 0.95.",
