  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script:\n\n1. **load_services() function**: It's loading the wrong part of the manifest. It's using `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring registry, but it should use `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` to get the authoritative deployment configuration.\n\n2. **check_health() function**: It hardcodes `/health` as the endpoint, but the manifest shows different endpoints for different services (e.g., cache-service uses `/ping`, worker-service uses `/status`).\n\n3. **compute_readiness_score() function**: The weight_map has all weights set to 1, but according to the requirements, it should be: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. **determine_status() function**: The critical_ok logic is wrong. It checks if ALL services are healthy, but it should only check HIGH-criticality services.\n\nLet me test a service first to confirm they're running, then fix these issues.",
