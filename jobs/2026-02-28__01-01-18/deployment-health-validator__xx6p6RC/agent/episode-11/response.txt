  "analysis": "Good! I've successfully updated the validator.py with the corrected topological sorting algorithm. The key change was in the `compute_startup_order` function where I fixed the dependency relationship - now `graph[dep].append(svc)` correctly represents that dependencies must come before the services that depend on them.",
  "plan": "Now I'll test the fixed validator to see if it produces the correct topological order and verify that the deployment report is generated correctly.",
