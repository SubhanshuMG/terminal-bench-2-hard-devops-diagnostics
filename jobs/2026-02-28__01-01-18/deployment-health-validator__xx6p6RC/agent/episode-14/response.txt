  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. Let me verify one final time:\n\n1. ✅ The validator correctly loads the 5 services from deployment.services (not the legacy services)\n2. ✅ It uses the correct health endpoints (auth-service: /health, cache-service: /ping, worker-service: /status, etc.)\n3. ✅ The readiness score calculation uses proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ The topological sorting produces the correct startup order\n5. ✅ The overall status logic correctly identifies 'degraded' status\n6. ✅ The critical_services_healthy correctly checks only high-criticality services\n7. ✅ The output JSON matches the expected schema exactly\n\nThe final report shows all services are properly health-checked, the startup order is topologically correct, and all fields match the required schema. The deployment pipeline validation tool is now functional.",
