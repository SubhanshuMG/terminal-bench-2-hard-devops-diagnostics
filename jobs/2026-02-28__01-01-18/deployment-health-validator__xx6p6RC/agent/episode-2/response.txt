  "analysis": "I can see the deployment manifest defines 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. The authoritative services are under 'deployment.services' and include: auth-service (8081, /health, high), api-gateway (8082, /health, high), cache-service (8083, /ping, medium), worker-service (8084, /status, low), and notification-service (8085, /health, low). Now I need to check if the mock services are running by testing one of the health endpoints.",
