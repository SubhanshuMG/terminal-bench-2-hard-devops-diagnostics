  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script:\n\n1. It's loading the wrong services list from the manifest - it's using `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring services instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` which contains the authoritative deployment services.\n\n2. The health check function is hardcoded to use `/health` endpoint, but the manifest shows different endpoints for different services (e.g., cache-service uses `/ping`, worker-service uses `/status`).\n\n3. The criticality weights in `compute_readiness_score` are all set to 1, but they should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. The `determine_status` function checks `all(services)` but should only check high-criticality services for critical services healthy.\n\nLet me test the current broken validator first to see the output, then fix these issues.",
