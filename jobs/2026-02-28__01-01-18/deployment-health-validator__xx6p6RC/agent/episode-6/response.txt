  "analysis": "As expected, the validator is broken. It's only finding the metrics-collector from the legacy services section instead of the 5 production services. I can see the issues clearly now:\n\n1. It's loading `config[\"services\"]` instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`\n2. The health check is using hardcoded `/health` instead of the actual endpoint from the service definition\n3. The readiness score weights are wrong (all 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. The critical services check is checking all services instead of just high-criticality ones\n\nI need to fix these issues to make the validator work correctly.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by addressing each issue: correct the service loading, fix the health endpoint, correct the weights, and fix the critical services check. Then I'll test it to ensure it produces the correct report.",
