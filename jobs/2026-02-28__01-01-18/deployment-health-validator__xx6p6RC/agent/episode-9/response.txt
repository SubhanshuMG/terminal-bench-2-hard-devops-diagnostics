  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. I can see that:\n\n1. It's correctly loading all 5 services from the deployment.services section\n2. It's using the correct health endpoints (noticed cache-service is now using `/ping` instead of hardcoded `/health`)\n3. The readiness score calculation is working with proper weights (0.9 score with 4 healthy services out of 5)\n4. The overall status is correctly set to 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is < 0.95\n\nHowever, I notice there's an issue with the startup order - it should be topologically sorted but the current order doesn't make sense. Let me check the generated report to see the full details and verify everything is correct.",
