I need to analyze the current situation and understand what files are available to fix the deployment health validator.

{
  "analysis": "I'm in the /app directory as root. I need to examine the existing files to understand the current state of the broken validator. I should start by listing the files in /app and then examining the deployment manifest, mock services, and the broken validator script to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the files in /app to confirm the structure. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their dependencies, and criticality levels. Next, I'll look at the broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed. Finally, I'll test the mock services to ensure they're running properly.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
