  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly. It successfully identified that 4 out of 5 services are healthy (auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, notification-service) and only worker-service is unhealthy due to the 503 status. The readiness score is 0.9 (90%) which is calculated as: high-criticality services (auth-service, api-gateway) each have weight 3, medium-criticality (cache-service) has weight 2, and low-criticality services (worker-service, notification-service) have weight 1. With worker-service being unhealthy, we have (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9. The overall status is 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is < 0.95.",
