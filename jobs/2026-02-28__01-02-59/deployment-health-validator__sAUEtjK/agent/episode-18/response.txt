  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is working correctly:\n\n1. ✅ It correctly loads services from the authoritative 'deployment.services' section of the manifest\n2. ✅ It uses the correct health endpoints for each service (/health, /ping, /status)\n3. ✅ It properly calculates the readiness score with correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ It correctly identifies the overall status as 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n5. ✅ It generates the correct startup order with proper topological sorting\n6. ✅ It correctly identifies critical_services_healthy as true since both high-criticality services are healthy\n7. ✅ The output report contains all required fields in the correct schema format\n\nThe readiness score of 0.9 is correct: (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9. The worker-service is correctly identified as unhealthy (503), but since it's low-criticality, the overall status is 'degraded' rather than 'critical'.",
