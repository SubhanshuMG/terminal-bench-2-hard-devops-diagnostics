  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. The `load_services` function is loading the wrong section - it's loading `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring registry) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment configuration).\n\n2. The `check_health` function is hardcoded to use `/health` endpoint, but the manifest shows some services use different endpoints (e.g., cache-service uses `/ping`, worker-service uses `/status`).\n\n3. The `compute_readiness_score` function has incorrect weights - all criticality levels are set to weight 1 instead of the required weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n4. The `determine_status` function has incorrect logic - it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality services for the critical_ok check.\n\n5. The topological sort in `compute_startup_order` has the dependency direction reversed - it's adding the dependent service as a neighbor of the dependency instead of vice versa.",
  "plan": "I'll fix these issues one by one. First, I'll test the current broken behavior to confirm it's not working, then I'll fix the issues and test the corrected version.",
