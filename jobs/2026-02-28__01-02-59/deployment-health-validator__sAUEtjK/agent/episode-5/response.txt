  "analysis": "As expected, the validator is broken. It's only loading the legacy 'services' section which only contains 'metrics-collector', and it's failing to connect to it. The health check is failing because it's using the wrong endpoint for the legacy service. I need to fix all the issues I identified.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by correcting the issues I identified: 1) Load from the correct deployment.services section, 2) Use the correct health endpoints for each service, 3) Fix the weight mapping for readiness score calculation, 4) Fix the critical services check logic, and 5) Fix the topological sort direction.",
