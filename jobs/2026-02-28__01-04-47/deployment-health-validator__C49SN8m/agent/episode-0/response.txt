  "analysis": "I'm starting in the `/app/` directory as root. I can see the prompt is ready. I need to first examine the existing files to understand the deployment manifest, check if mock services are running, and analyze the broken validator.py script.",
  "plan": "My first steps will be to: 1) List all files in /app/ to see what's available, 2) Examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services and their configurations, 3) Check if the mock services are running by testing a health endpoint, 4) Look at the current validator.py to understand what's broken.",
