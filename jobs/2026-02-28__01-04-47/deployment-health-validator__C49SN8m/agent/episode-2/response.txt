  "analysis": "Perfect! I can see the deployment manifest clearly defines 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. The services are: auth-service (8081/health, high), api-gateway (8082/health, high), cache-service (8083/ping, medium), worker-service (8084/status, low), and notification-service (8085/health, low). Now I need to check if the mock services are running and examine the broken validator.py.",
