  "analysis": "The validator is running and producing output, but there are some issues: 1) The startup order looks incorrect - it should be topologically sorted with dependencies before dependents, 2) The score calculation seems wrong - with 4 healthy services out of 5, the weighted score should be higher than 0.6, 3) The overall status is 'not_ready' which might be correct given the score. Let me examine the generated report to understand what's happening.",
