  "analysis": "I can see several issues: 1) The startup order is incorrect - it should have dependencies first, so auth-service and cache-service should come before api-gateway, and api-gateway and cache-service should come before worker-service, 2) The readiness score calculation seems wrong - let me verify the math: high(3) + high(3) + medium(2) + low(1) = 9 total, healthy: high(3) + high(3) + medium(2) + low(1) = 9, so score should be 9/10 = 0.9, not 0.6. The issue is likely in the startup order algorithm.",
  "plan": "I need to fix the compute_startup_order function. Looking at the current output, it seems like the dependency relationships are inverted in the algorithm. Let me examine and fix the topological sort logic.",
