  "analysis": "I can see two major issues: 1) The startup order is completely wrong - it only shows 'notification-service' and is missing other services, 2) The critical_services_healthy is false even though both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy. The overall_status is 'critical' because critical_services_healthy is false, which is incorrect. Let me debug the startup order algorithm.",
