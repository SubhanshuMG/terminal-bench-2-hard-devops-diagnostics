  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script. The main problems are: 1) `load_services()` is loading from the wrong section - it's using the top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services', 2) `check_health()` is hardcoded to use '/health' instead of the actual health_endpoint from the manifest, 3) `compute_readiness_score()` has incorrect weights (all set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1), 4) `determine_status()` is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for the critical_ok check.",
  "plan": "I need to fix these issues in the validator.py script. I'll modify: 1) `load_services()` to load from config['deployment']['services'], 2) `check_health()` to use the correct health_endpoint, 3) Fix the weight mapping in `compute_readiness_score()`, 4) Fix the critical_ok check in `determine_status()` to only check high-criticality services.",
