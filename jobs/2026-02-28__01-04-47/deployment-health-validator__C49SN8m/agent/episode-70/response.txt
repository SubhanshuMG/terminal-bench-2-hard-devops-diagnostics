The deployment report is now correctly generated with all fields properly populated: 1) overall_status is 'degraded' (correct: all high-criticality services healthy, score=0.9 < 0.95), 2) readiness_score is 0.9 (correct: (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9), 3) startup_order is topologically correct, 4) critical_services_healthy is true (both high-criticality services are healthy).
