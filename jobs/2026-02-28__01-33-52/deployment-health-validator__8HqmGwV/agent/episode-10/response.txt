  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only finding the `metrics-collector` from the top-level `services` section instead of the authoritative `deployment.services` section. It's not checking any of the actual services (auth-service, api-gateway, etc.). I need to fix the `load_services()` function first.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the `load_services()` function to read from the correct part of the YAML file (deployment.services instead of top-level services), then run the validator again to see if it picks up the correct services.",
