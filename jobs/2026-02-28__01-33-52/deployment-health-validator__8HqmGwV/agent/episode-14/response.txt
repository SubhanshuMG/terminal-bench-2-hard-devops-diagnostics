  "analysis": "Great progress! The validator is now correctly identifying all 5 services. However, I can see several issues:\n\n1. **api-gateway shows unhealthy with HTTP 200** - this shouldn't happen since HTTP 200 should be healthy\n2. **The startup order is wrong** - notification-service should not come first; dependencies should come before dependents\n3. **The readiness score is 0.6** - this is likely because the weights are wrong (all set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n\nLet me check the generated report and then fix these issues.",
