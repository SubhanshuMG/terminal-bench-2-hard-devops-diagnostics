  "analysis": "Now I can see the issues clearly:\n\n1. **api-gateway shows as unhealthy despite HTTP 200** - This suggests the JSON parsing/validation logic in check_health() might be wrong\n2. **The startup order is completely backwards** - notification-service should come last, not first\n3. **critical_services_healthy is false** - This should only check high-criticality services, but it's likely checking all services\n4. **The readiness score calculation is wrong** - All weights are set to 1 instead of the correct weights\n\nLet me investigate the api-gateway issue first by checking what response it's actually getting.",
