  "analysis": "The api-gateway is returning a valid JSON response with status='healthy', which should be considered healthy. The issue must be in the check_health() function's JSON validation logic. Looking at the code, I see the problem: the check is `body.get(\"status\", \"ok\") in (\"ok\", \"up\")` but the api-gateway returns \"healthy\" not \"ok\" or \"up\". The validator should accept \"healthy\" as a valid status too.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the check_health() function to accept \"healthy\" as a valid status, then fix the other issues: correct the readiness score weights, fix the startup order logic, and fix the critical_services_healthy logic.",
