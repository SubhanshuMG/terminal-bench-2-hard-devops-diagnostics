This suggests there's an issue with the topological sort algorithm.\n\n2. **Overall status is still 'critical'** - This might be because the critical_services_healthy logic is still wrong, or there might be an issue with the dependency graph.\n\nLet me check the generated report and then fix the startup order algorithm.",
