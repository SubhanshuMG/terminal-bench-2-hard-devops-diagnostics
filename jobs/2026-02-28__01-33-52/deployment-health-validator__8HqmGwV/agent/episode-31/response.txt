  "analysis": "I notice there's a discrepancy in the readiness score calculation. The score should be 8/10 = 0.8, but the validator is reporting 0.9. Let me check if there's an issue with the readiness score calculation. The score of 0.9 suggests that 9 out of 10 weighted points are healthy, which would mean one of the low-criticality services is actually healthy when it should be unhealthy.",
  "plan": "I'll check the worker-service status more carefully. The worker-service should return 503 (unhealthy) but maybe the validator is incorrectly marking it as healthy.",
