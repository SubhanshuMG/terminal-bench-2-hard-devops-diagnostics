I was thinking only 3 services are healthy, but there are actually 4 healthy services:\n- auth-service (high, weight 3)\n- api-gateway (high, weight 3) \n- cache-service (medium, weight 2)\n- notification-service (low, weight 1)\n\nThe only unhealthy service is worker-service (low, weight 1). So healthy weights = 3+3+2+1 = 9, total weights = 10, score = 9/10 = 0.9. The calculation is correct!",
