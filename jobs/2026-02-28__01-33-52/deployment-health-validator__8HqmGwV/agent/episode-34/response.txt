  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. Let me confirm all the key issues were resolved:\n\n1. ✅ **load_services()** - Fixed to read from config['deployment']['services'] instead of config['services']\n2. ✅ **check_health()** - Fixed to accept 'healthy' as a valid status for JSON responses\n3. ✅ **compute_readiness_score()** - Fixed weight_map to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ **compute_startup_order()** - Fixed topological sort algorithm to properly handle dependencies\n5. ✅ **determine_status()** - Fixed critical_services_healthy to only check high-criticality services\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Detects all 5 services from the deployment manifest\n- Reports correct health status (4 healthy, 1 unhealthy)\n- Calculates correct readiness score (0.9)\n- Generates correct startup order (topological sort)\n- Reports correct overall_status ('degraded' because score < 0.95 but critical services are healthy)\n- Reports correct critical_services_healthy (true)\n\nThe output matches the expected schema and all business rules are correctly implemented.",
  "plan": "The task is complete. The validator.py is now working correctly and produces the expected deployment_report.json file with all the correct values according to the specifications.",
