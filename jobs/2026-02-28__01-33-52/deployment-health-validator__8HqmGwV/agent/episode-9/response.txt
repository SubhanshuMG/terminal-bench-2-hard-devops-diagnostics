  "analysis": "Now I can see the validator.py file and identify several issues that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **load_services()**: It's reading from the wrong part of the YAML. It's using the top-level 'services' instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services'.\n\n2. **compute_startup_order()**: The graph building logic is backwards. It's adding dependencies as if they depend on the service, but it should be the other way around - dependencies should come before dependents.\n\n3. **compute_readiness_score()**: The weight_map is wrong - it sets all weights to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n4. **determine_status()**: The critical_ok logic is wrong - it checks all services instead of just high-criticality services.\n\nLet me run the current validator to see what output it produces, then fix these issues.",
