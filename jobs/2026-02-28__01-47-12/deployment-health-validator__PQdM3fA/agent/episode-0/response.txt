  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory as root. I need to investigate the current state of the deployment validation system. The task indicates that there are three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml (defines services), mock_services.py (running background services), and validator.py (the broken script that needs fixing). I should first examine these files to understand the current setup and identify what's wrong with validator.py.",
  "plan": "I'll start by listing the contents of /app to confirm the files are present, then examine each file in sequence: first the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, then check if the mock services are actually running, and finally examine the broken validator.py to identify the issues that need to be fixed.",
