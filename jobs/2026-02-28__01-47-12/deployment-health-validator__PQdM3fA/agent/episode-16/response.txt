  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is now correctly generated and matches the expected schema. All 5 services are properly checked and included, the startup order is correct (with dependencies like cache-service coming before api-gateway), the readiness score is 1.0 (since all services are healthy), the overall status is 'healthy' (because all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95), and critical_services_healthy is true. Let me verify the readiness score calculation manually to ensure it's correct.",
  "plan": "I'll manually verify the readiness score calculation to confirm it's working correctly. With all 5 services healthy, we should have:\n- Total weight: 2 high (3 each) + 1 medium (2) + 2 low (1 each) = 2*3 + 1*2 + 2*1 = 10\n- Healthy weight: same as total since all are healthy = 10\n- Score: 10/10 = 1.0\n\nThis matches what we see in the report.",
