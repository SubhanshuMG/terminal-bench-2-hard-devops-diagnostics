The validator successfully:\n\n1. **Loads all 5 services** from the correct section of the deployment manifest (deployment.services instead of the legacy monitoring section)\n2. **Correctly checks health** of all services by probing their respective health endpoints\n3. **Computes the right startup order** using proper topological sorting with correct dependency direction\n4. **Calculates the correct readiness score** using proper criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. **Determines the correct overall status** based on high-criticality services being healthy and the readiness score >= 0.95\n6. **Generates the expected JSON report** at /app/deployment_report.json with all required fields\n\nThe report shows:\n- All 5 services are healthy\n- Overall status: 'healthy' (all high-criticality services healthy + score >= 0.95)\n- Readiness score: 1.0 (perfect score since all services are healthy)\n- Startup order: correctly sorted topologically\n- Critical services healthy: true (both high-criticality services are healthy)",
