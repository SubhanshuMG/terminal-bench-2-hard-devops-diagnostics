I can see there are 5 services defined in the deployment.services section: auth-service (port 8081, high criticality), api-gateway (port 8082, high criticality), cache-service (port 8083, medium criticality), worker-service (port 8084, low criticality), and notification-service (port 8085, low criticality). I can also see the dependencies between them. Now I need to check if the mock services are actually running and then examine the broken validator.py.",
