  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed the broken deployment health validator by addressing all the critical issues:\n\n1. **Fixed service loading**: Changed from loading `config[\"services\"]` (legacy monitoring) to `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (authoritative deployment services)\n2. **Fixed criticality weights**: Changed from all weights=1 to high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. **Fixed critical services check**: Changed from checking ALL services to only checking HIGH-criticality services\n4. **Fixed dependency direction**: Corrected the topological sort to ensure dependencies appear before their dependents\n5. **Verified functionality**: The validator now correctly processes all 5 services, computes the correct readiness score of 1.0, and generates the expected JSON report\n\nThe deployment_report.json now contains all 5 services, has the correct overall_status of 'healthy', proper readiness_score of 1.0, correct startup_order, and all high-level requirements are met.",
