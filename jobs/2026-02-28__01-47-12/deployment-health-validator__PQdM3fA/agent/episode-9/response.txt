  "analysis": "Now I can see the issues with the validator.py! There are several critical bugs:\n\n1. **Wrong service loading**: The `load_services()` function is loading the wrong section of the manifest. It's loading `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment services).\n\n2. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all weights are set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Wrong criteria for critical services**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of checking if HIGH-criticality services are healthy.\n\n4. **Wrong dependency direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the dependency graph is built incorrectly - it's adding dependencies as if they depend on the current service, when it should be the other way around.\n\n5. **Wrong services being processed**: The validator is only processing 1 service (the legacy metrics-collector) instead of all 5 deployment services.\n\nLet me run the current broken validator to confirm the issues, then fix them.",
  "plan": "I'll first run the current broken validator to see what it produces, then fix each of the identified bugs in sequence. The main fixes needed are: correct the service loading, fix the criticality weights, fix the critical services check, fix the dependency direction, and ensure all 5 services are processed.",
