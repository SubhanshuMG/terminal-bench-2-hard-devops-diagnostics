  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is working correctly. I have successfully fixed all the critical bugs in the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Fixed service loading**: Now correctly loads from `config['deployment']['services']` instead of the wrong top-level `services`\n2. **Fixed criticality weights**: Now uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) instead of all weights being 1\n3. **Fixed topological sort**: Now correctly builds the dependency graph with dependencies pointing to dependents\n4. **Fixed critical services logic**: Now only checks high-criticality services instead of all services\n\nThe validator correctly identifies that all services are healthy, computes the proper startup order (dependencies first), calculates the correct readiness score (1.0), and generates a proper report that matches the expected schema exactly.",
