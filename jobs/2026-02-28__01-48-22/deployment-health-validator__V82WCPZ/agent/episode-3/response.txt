  "analysis": "I can see several critical bugs in the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The `load_services()` function loads from the top-level `services` list (which only has metrics-collector), but it should load from `deployment.services` which contains all 5 services.\n\n2. **Incorrect criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all weights are set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Wrong dependency direction in topological sort**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph building is backwards - it should have dependencies point TO the service that depends on them, not FROM the service to its dependencies.\n\n4. **Incorrect critical_services_healthy logic**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking ALL services instead of only high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test if the mock services are running, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test if the mock services are running by curling a few endpoints. Then I'll fix the bugs one by one: correct the service loading, fix the weights, fix the topological sort, and fix the critical services logic.",
