I need to analyze the current situation and fix the broken validator script. Let me start by exploring the files in the `/app/` directory to understand the current state.

{
  "analysis": "I'm in the /app directory as root. I can see the task requires fixing a broken validator.py script that validates deployment health for five microservices. The mock services are already running, and I need to examine the deployment_manifest.yaml and the current validator.py to understand what's broken.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the files in /app to confirm the structure, then examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, then look at the current validator.py to identify the issues, and finally fix the script to produce the correct deployment_report.json.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
