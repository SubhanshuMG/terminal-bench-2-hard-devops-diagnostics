  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py script has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. The deployment report is generated at /app/deployment_report.json with all 5 services properly loaded, health checks passing, correct topological sort order, proper readiness score calculation with weighted criticality levels, and the report schema matches the required format exactly.",
  "plan": "The task is complete. The validator now correctly: 1) Loads services from the authoritative deployment.services section, 2) Performs proper topological sorting with dependencies before dependents, 3) Uses correct weights for readiness score (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 4) Only checks high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy, and 5) Generates the correct overall status based on the defined rules.",
