  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema exactly. All the bugs have been successfully fixed:\n\n1. ✅ **load_services()** - Now reads from the correct YAML section (`config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`)\n2. ✅ **compute_readiness_score()** - Uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ **determine_status()** - Only checks high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. ✅ **compute_startup_order()** - Correctly builds dependency graph with dependencies pointing to services that depend on them\n\nThe report shows:\n- All services are healthy (status: \"healthy\")\n- Readiness score is 1.0 (100% healthy)\n- Overall status is \"healthy\" (all high-criticality services healthy AND score >= 0.95)\n- Startup order is correct: auth-service → cache-service → api-gateway → worker-service → notification-service\n- Critical services healthy is true (both high-criticality services - auth-service and api-gateway - are healthy)\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and the deployment pipeline should function properly.",
