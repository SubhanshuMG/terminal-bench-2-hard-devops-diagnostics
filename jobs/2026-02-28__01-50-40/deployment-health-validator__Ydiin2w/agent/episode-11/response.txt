  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed all the critical bugs in the validator.py file and verified that the deployment health validation tool is now working correctly. The validator generates a proper deployment report that matches the expected schema exactly. Let me quickly verify one more time that all requirements are met:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to read from the authoritative deployment.services section\n2. ✅ Fixed compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. ✅ Fixed compute_startup_order() to build the dependency graph correctly\n5. ✅ All services are properly health-checked via their correct endpoints\n6. ✅ The report is written to /app/deployment_report.json with the correct schema\n7. ✅ Overall status calculation follows the specified rules\n8. ✅ Startup order is topologically sorted correctly\n\nThe validator is now functioning correctly and ready for the deployment pipeline.",
