  "analysis": "I've identified several critical bugs in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **load_services()** - It's reading from the wrong section of the YAML. It reads `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment section).\n\n2. **compute_readiness_score()** - The weight_map has all criticality levels set to 1, but according to the spec it should be: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **determine_status()** - It's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality services. The spec says critical_services_healthy should only check high-criticality services.\n\n4. **compute_startup_order()** - The dependency graph is built incorrectly. It's adding dependencies as children when it should be the reverse - dependencies should be parents of services that depend on them.",
  "plan": "I'll fix these bugs one by one:\n1. Fix load_services() to read from the correct YAML section\n2. Fix the weight_map in compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights\n3. Fix determine_status() to only check high-criticality services\n4. Fix the dependency graph construction in compute_startup_order()",
