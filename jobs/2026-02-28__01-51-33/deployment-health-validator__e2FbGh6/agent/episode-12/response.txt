The generated report matches the expected schema exactly:\n\n1. **deployment_name**: \"production-stack\" ✓\n2. **overall_status**: \"healthy\" (all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95) ✓\n3. **readiness_score**: 1.0 (all services healthy with correct weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1) ✓\n4. **service_statuses**: All 5 services with correct status, http_status, and criticality ✓\n5. **startup_order**: Correct topological sort (dependencies before dependents) ✓\n6. **critical_services_healthy**: true (both high-criticality services are healthy) ✓\n7. **timestamp**: Proper ISO format ✓\n\nAll the fixes I implemented are working correctly:\n- Fixed load_services() to use deployment.services instead of legacy services\n- Fixed weight_map to use correct weights (3,2,1)\n- Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services\n- Fixed topological sort to have correct dependency direction\n\nThe task is now complete!",
