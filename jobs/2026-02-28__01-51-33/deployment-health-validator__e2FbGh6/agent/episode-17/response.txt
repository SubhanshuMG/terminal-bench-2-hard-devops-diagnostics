  "analysis": "Excellent! All verifications are complete and successful. The validator.py is now working correctly and producing a perfect deployment report that meets all requirements:\n\n✅ **All Issues Fixed:**\n1. Fixed `load_services()` to load `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` instead of legacy `config[\"services\"]`\n2. Fixed `weight_map` to use correct weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. Fixed `determine_status()` to only check high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. Fixed topological sort in `compute_startup_order()` to have correct dependency direction\n\n✅ **Report Validation:**\n- All 7 required fields are present\n- Overall status is 'healthy' (correct: all high-criticality services healthy + score >= 0.95)\n- Readiness score is 1.0 (correct: all services healthy with proper weights)\n- Startup order is correct topological sort\n- Critical services healthy is True\n- All 5 services have proper status entries\n\nThe deployment health validator is now fully functional and ready for production use.",
