All critical bugs have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to load the authoritative deployment.services section\n2. ✅ Fixed weight_map to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services\n4. ✅ Fixed topological sort to have correct dependency direction\n\nThe report is properly generated with all required fields:\n- deployment_name: \"production-stack\"\n- overall_status: \"healthy\" (correct logic applied)\n- readiness_score: 1.0 (weighted calculation correct)\n- service_statuses: All 5 services with proper status/criticality\n- startup_order: Correct topological sort\n- critical_services_healthy: true\n- timestamp: Proper ISO format\n\nAll services are healthy and the validator produces the expected JSON output at /app/deployment_report.json.
