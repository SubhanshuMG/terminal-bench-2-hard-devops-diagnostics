  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py file:\n\n1. **Critical Issue**: The `load_services()` function is loading the wrong section of the manifest. It's loading `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment configuration).\n\n2. **Bug in weight_map**: The `compute_readiness_score()` function has all weights set to 1, but according to the requirements, it should be: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Bug in determine_status()**: The critical_ok check is checking all services instead of only high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Bug in topological sort**: The `compute_startup_order()` function has the dependency direction backwards - it's adding dependencies as children instead of parents.\n\nLet me first verify the mock services are running, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll verify that the mock services are running by testing a few endpoints. Then I'll fix the validator.py by correcting the load_services function, fixing the weight_map, fixing the critical_services check, and correcting the topological sort algorithm.",
