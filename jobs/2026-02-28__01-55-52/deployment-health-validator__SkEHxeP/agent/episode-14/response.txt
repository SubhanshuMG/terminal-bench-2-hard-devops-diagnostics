  "analysis": "Excellent! The fixed validator is working correctly. I can see that:\n\n1. It's now loading the correct 5 services from the deployment section\n2. It's checking JSON health status correctly (worker-service shows as unhealthy despite HTTP 200, which means it found a non-healthy status in the JSON response)\n3. The startup order is correctly computed with dependencies first\n4. The readiness score is calculated with proper weights (0.9000)\n5. The status is correctly determined as 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is < 0.95\n\nLet me check the generated report to make sure it matches the expected schema.",
