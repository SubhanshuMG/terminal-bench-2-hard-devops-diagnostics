  "analysis": "Perfect! The generated report matches exactly the expected schema. All requirements are now satisfied:\n\n1. ✅ Correct deployment name: \"production-stack\"\n2. ✅ Correct overall_status: \"degraded\" (all high-criticality services healthy, score < 0.95)\n3. ✅ Correct readiness_score: 0.9 (weighted calculation with high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ Service statuses with correct format including http_status, criticality, and status\n5. ✅ Correct startup_order with topological sorting (dependencies before dependents)\n6. ✅ critical_services_healthy: true (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n7. ✅ Proper timestamp format\n\nThe key fixes that made this work:\n- Loading services from the correct deployment section\n- Proper weight mapping for readiness score calculation\n- Correct topological sort direction\n- JSON health status checking that identified worker-service as unhealthy despite HTTP 200\n- Correct logic for checking only high-criticality services\n\nThe task is now complete and the deployment validator is working correctly.",
