It correctly identifies that:\n- auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, and notification-service are healthy\n- worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but 'degraded' status)\n- The readiness score is 0.9 (90%)\n- Overall status is 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n\nLet me check the generated report to confirm it matches the expected schema and contains all the correct information.",
