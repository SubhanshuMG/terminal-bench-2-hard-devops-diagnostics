  "analysis": "Perfect! Now I understand the service behavior. From the mock services, I can see that:\n1. auth-service (8081) returns HTTP 200 with {\"status\": \"ok\"} - should be healthy\n2. api-gateway (8082) returns HTTP 200 with {\"status\": \"healthy\"} - should be healthy  \n3. cache-service (8083) returns HTTP 200 with \"pong\" - should be healthy (non-JSON response)\n4. worker-service (8084) returns HTTP 200 with {\"status\": \"degraded\"} - should be UNHEALTHY due to degraded status\n5. notification-service (8085) returns HTTP 200 with {\"status\": \"ok\"} - should be healthy\n\nSo worker-service is the problematic one with HTTP 200 but unhealthy status. Let me examine the broken validator.py to see what needs to be fixed.",
