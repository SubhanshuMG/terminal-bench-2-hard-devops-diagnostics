  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong manifest loading**: The `load_services()` function is reading from the wrong section of the YAML. It's reading `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring registry, but it should read `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` for the authoritative deployment configuration.\n\n2. **Missing JSON parsing**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code but doesn't parse JSON responses to check the `status` field. According to the requirements, a service is only healthy if HTTP 200 AND the JSON `status` field is one of the accepted values (\"ok\", \"up\", \"healthy\").\n\n3. **Wrong weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, the weight_map is set to all 1s instead of the correct weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking ALL services instead of just high-criticality services for the `critical_ok` calculation.\n\n5. **Wrong dependency graph direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph is built with dependencies pointing the wrong way, which will give incorrect topological ordering.\n\nLet me test the current broken version first to confirm it's broken, then fix these issues.",
