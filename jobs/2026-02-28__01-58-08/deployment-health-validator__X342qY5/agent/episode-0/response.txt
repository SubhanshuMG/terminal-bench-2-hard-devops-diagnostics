I need to analyze the current situation and understand what files are available, then examine the broken validator script to fix it.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory as root. I need to first explore what files are available, then examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services and their configurations, and finally look at the broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of /app to confirm the files mentioned in the task. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. After that, I'll look at the validator.py to identify what's broken and fix it.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
