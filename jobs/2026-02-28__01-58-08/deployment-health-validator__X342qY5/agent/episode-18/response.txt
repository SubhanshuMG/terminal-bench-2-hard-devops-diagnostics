  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema. All requirements are met: 1) The worker-service is correctly identified as unhealthy due to 'degraded' status in JSON, 2) All 5 services are properly evaluated, 3) The readiness score is 0.9 (which is 9/10 weighted services healthy: 3+3+2+1 for healthy services = 9, total = 3+3+2+1+1 = 10), 4) Both high-criticality services are healthy, so critical_services_healthy is true and overall_status is 'degraded' (score < 0.95 but >= 0.70).",
