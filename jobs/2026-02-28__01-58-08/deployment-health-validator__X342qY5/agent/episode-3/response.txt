  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script. The main problems are: 1) It's loading the wrong services list from the manifest (it's using the top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services'), 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score has wrong weights (all set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The determine_status function is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for the 'critical' status, and 4) The check_health function doesn't handle JSON responses with status fields as mentioned in the task description.",
  "plan": "I need to test the current validator first to see the exact issues, then fix each problem: 1) Load services from deployment.services, 2) Fix the weight mapping, 3) Fix the critical services check, and 4) Add proper JSON status field checking for health endpoints.",
