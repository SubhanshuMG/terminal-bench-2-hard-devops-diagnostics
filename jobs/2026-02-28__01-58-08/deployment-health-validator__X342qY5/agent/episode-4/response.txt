  "analysis": "As expected, the validator is broken. It's only loading the legacy 'metrics-collector' service instead of the 5 production services from 'deployment.services'. I need to fix the load_services function and then address the other issues. Let me also check what the mock services are actually returning to understand the health check requirements.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test the actual production services to see their health responses, then I'll fix the validator.py script step by step: 1) Fix load_services to use deployment.services, 2) Fix the weight mapping, 3) Fix the critical services check, 4) Add JSON status field parsing.",
