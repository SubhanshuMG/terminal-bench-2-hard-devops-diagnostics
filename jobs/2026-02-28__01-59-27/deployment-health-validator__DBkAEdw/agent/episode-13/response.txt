It successfully:\n\n1. ✅ Loaded the correct services from deployment.services\n2. ✅ Correctly identified worker-service as unhealthy (HTTP 200 but JSON shows \"degraded\")\n3. ✅ Computed the correct topological startup order\n4. ✅ Calculated the correct readiness score (0.9 instead of the previous incorrect score)\n5. ✅ Set the overall status to \"degraded\" (since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95)\n\nLet me check the generated report to make sure it matches the expected schema.",
