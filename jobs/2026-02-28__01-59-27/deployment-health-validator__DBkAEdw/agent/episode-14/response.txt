Let me verify the key points:\n\n✅ **deployment_name**: \"production-stack\" - correct\n✅ **overall_status**: \"degraded\" - correct (all high-criticality services healthy but score 0.9 < 0.95)\n✅ **readiness_score**: 0.9 - correct calculation (weighted: high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n✅ **service_statuses**: All services correctly categorized with proper criticality levels\n✅ **startup_order**: Correct topological sort based on dependencies\n✅ **critical_services_healthy**: true - correct (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n✅ **timestamp**: ISO format with timezone\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and produces the expected output.
