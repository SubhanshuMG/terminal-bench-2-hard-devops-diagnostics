  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed all the issues in the validator.py file:\n\n1. ✅ **Fixed service loading**: Changed from `config[\"services\"]` to `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` to use the authoritative service definitions\n\n2. ✅ **Added JSON health check logic**: Implemented proper health checking that considers both HTTP status and JSON response content. Services returning \"degraded\" in JSON are correctly marked as unhealthy despite HTTP 200\n\n3. ✅ **Fixed criticality weights**: Changed weight_map from all 1s to correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n\n4. ✅ **Fixed topological sort**: Corrected the dependency direction in the graph building\n\n5. ✅ **Fixed critical services check**: Changed to only check high-criticality services instead of all services\n\nThe validator now correctly identifies the worker-service as unhealthy due to its \"degraded\" JSON status, calculates the correct readiness score of 0.9, and produces the expected \"degraded\" overall status since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is below 0.95.",
