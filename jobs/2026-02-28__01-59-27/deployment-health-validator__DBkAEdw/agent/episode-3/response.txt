  "analysis": "Now I can see several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong service loading**: The `load_services()` function returns `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative section).\n\n2. **Missing JSON health check logic**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code but doesn't handle JSON responses that might indicate unhealthy states (like the task description mentions).\n\n3. **Incorrect criticality weights**: The `compute_readiness_score()` uses weight_map with all values set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n4. **Topological sort issue**: The `compute_startup_order()` has the dependency direction reversed - it's adding dependencies as if they depend on the service rather than the service depending on them.\n\n5. **Critical services check**: The `determine_status()` function checks ALL services for health instead of only high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the mock services to understand their actual health responses responses.",
