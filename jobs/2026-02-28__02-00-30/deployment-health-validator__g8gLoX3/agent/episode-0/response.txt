  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to examine the existing files to understand the broken validator. I need to look at the deployment manifest to understand the services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels.",
  "plan": "First, I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml file to understand the service configurations. Then I'll look at the current validator.py to see what's broken. I'll also verify that the mock services are running by testing a few endpoints.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
