  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. It shows that most services are healthy, but worker-service is unhealthy despite HTTP 200, which means my JSON health checking logic is working - it's detecting that the worker-service returns HTTP 200 but has an unhealthy status in its JSON body.

  "plan": "Let me check the generated report to verify it matches the expected schema and then test a few endpoints manually to understand why worker-service is unhealthy.",
