  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py:\n\n1. The load_services function is loading from the wrong part of the manifest - it's using `config['services']` which is the legacy monitoring registry, but it should be using `config['deployment']['services']` for the authoritative deployment configuration.\n\n2. The check_health function doesn't handle JSON responses properly - it only checks HTTP status code, but according to the requirements, it needs to check the JSON body for accepted operational values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy').\n\n3. The compute_readiness_score function has incorrect weights - all criticality levels have weight 1, but they should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n4. The determine_status function is checking all services for critical_ok, but it should only check high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the current endpoints to see their responses.",
