  "analysis": "Perfect! The task is now complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. Let me summarize what was accomplished:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to load from deployment.services instead of services (legacy registry)\n2. ✅ Fixed check_health() to properly handle JSON responses and check for accepted operational values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy')\n3. ✅ Fixed compute_readiness_score() with correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_ok\n5. ✅ Fixed compute_startup_order() with correct topological sort algorithm\n6. ✅ The report now matches the expected schema with correct startup order\n7. ✅ The deployment_report.json is properly generated\n\nThe validator correctly identifies that worker-service is unhealthy despite HTTP 200 (due to 'degraded' status in JSON), computes the correct readiness score (0.9), and determines the correct overall status ('degraded') since all critical services are healthy but score < 0.95.",
