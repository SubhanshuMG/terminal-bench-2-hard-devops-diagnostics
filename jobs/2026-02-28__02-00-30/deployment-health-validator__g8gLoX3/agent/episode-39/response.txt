  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed with all the identified issues resolved:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed manifest loading - now loads from deployment.services instead of the legacy services registry\n2. ✅ Fixed JSON health checking - properly checks for accepted operational values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy') in JSON responses while allowing non-JSON responses with HTTP 200\n3. ✅ Fixed readiness score weights - high=3, medium=2, low=1 as specified\n4. ✅ Fixed critical services logic - only checks high-criticality services for critical_ok\n5. ✅ Fixed topological sort - dependencies now properly come before dependents in startup order\n6. ✅ The report matches the expected schema exactly\n7. ✅ The deployment_report.json is correctly generated\n\nThe validator correctly identifies that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but JSON status 'degraded'), computes the correct readiness score of 0.9, and determines the correct overall status of 'degraded' since all critical services are healthy but the score is below 0.95.",
