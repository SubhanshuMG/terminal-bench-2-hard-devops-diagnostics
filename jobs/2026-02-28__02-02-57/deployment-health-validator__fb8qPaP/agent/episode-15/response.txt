  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. I can see that:\n\n1. It correctly identified that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but 'degraded' status in JSON)\n2. The startup order is correct with dependencies before dependents\n3. The readiness score is 0.9 (4 healthy services out of 5, with proper weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. The overall status is 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n\nLet me check the generated deployment report to ensure it matches the expected schema.",
