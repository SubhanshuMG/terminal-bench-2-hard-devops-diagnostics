Let me verify the key calculations:\n\n1. **Readiness score calculation**: \n   - Total weight: auth(3) + api-gateway(3) + cache(2) + worker(1) + notification(1) = 10\n   - Healthy weight: auth(3) + api-gateway(3) + cache(2) + notification(1) = 9\n   - Score: 9/10 = 0.9 ✓\n\n2. **Overall status**: 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but score (0.9) < 0.95 ✓\n\n3. **Critical services healthy**: True because both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy ✓\n\n4. **Startup order**: Correct topological order with dependencies before dependents ✓\n\n5. **Service health**: Correctly identified worker-service as unhealthy due to 'degraded' status in JSON ✓\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and the task is complete.",
