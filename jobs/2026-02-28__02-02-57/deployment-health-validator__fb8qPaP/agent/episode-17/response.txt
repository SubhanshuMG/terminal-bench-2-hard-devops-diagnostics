I need to verify that the validator handles all the requirements properly:\n\n1. ✅ Correctly loads services from deployment.services (not top-level services)\n2. ✅ Properly weights services (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Correctly parses JSON responses and identifies unhealthy services with 'degraded' status\n4. ✅ Computes correct readiness score (0.9)\n5. ✅ Determines correct overall status ('degraded')\n6. ✅ Generates correct startup order\n7. ✅ Correctly identifies that critical services are healthy\n\nLet me run one final test to make sure the validator is robust and produces consistent results.",
