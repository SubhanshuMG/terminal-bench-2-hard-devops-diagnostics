  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is working consistently and correctly. All the key requirements are met:\n\n1. **Manifest loading**: Correctly loads from deployment.services (not the legacy top-level services)\n2. **JSON parsing**: Correctly identifies worker-service as unhealthy due to 'degraded' status in JSON body despite HTTP 200\n3. **Weights**: Uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. **Readiness score**: Correctly calculates 0.9 (9 healthy weight out of 10 total weight)\n5. **Overall status**: Correctly 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n6. **Startup order**: Correct topological ordering with dependencies before dependents\n7. **Critical services**: Correctly identifies that critical services are healthy (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n\nThe deployment_report.json contains all required fields and matches the expected schema. The validator is now fixed and working as specified.",
