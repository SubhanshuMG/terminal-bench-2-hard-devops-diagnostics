  "analysis": "I have thoroughly verified that the deployment health validator is working correctly. The fixed validator.py addresses all the issues identified in the original broken version:\n\n1. **Correct manifest loading**: Now loads from config['deployment']['services'] instead of config['services']\n2. **Proper JSON parsing**: Added logic to parse JSON responses and check for accepted operational values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy')\n3. **Correct weights**: Fixed readiness score calculation with proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. **Fixed topological sort**: Corrected startup order to have dependencies start before dependents\n5. **Accurate critical services check**: Now only checks high-criticality services for the critical_services_healthy flag\n\nThe validator correctly identifies that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but 'degraded' status in JSON), calculates the correct readiness score of 0.9, and produces a deployment report that matches the expected schema. All requirements have been met.",
