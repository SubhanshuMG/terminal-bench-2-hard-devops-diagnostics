  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong manifest loading**: The function `load_services()` returns the top-level 'services' list, but according to the manifest, the authoritative service definitions are under 'deployment.services', not the top-level 'services'.\n\n2. **Incorrect readiness score weights**: The `compute_readiness_score()` function has all criticality levels mapped to weight 1, but according to the task description, the weights should be: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Missing JSON body parsing**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code 200, but doesn't parse JSON responses to check the 'status' field for accepted operational values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy').\n\n4. **Incorrect startup order logic**: The topological sort has the dependency relationships backwards - it should make dependencies start before their dependents, but the current code adds dependencies as neighbors in the wrong direction.\n\n5. **Wrong critical services check**: The `determine_status()` function checks if ALL services are healthy instead of just high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the services to understand their responses.",
  "plan": "I'll test a few service endpoints to understand what responses they return, particularly to identify any that return HTTP 200 but have unhealthy status in the JSON body. Then I'll fix the validator.py issues.",
