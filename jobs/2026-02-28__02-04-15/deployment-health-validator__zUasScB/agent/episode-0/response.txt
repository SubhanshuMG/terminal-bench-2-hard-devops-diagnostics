  "analysis": "I'm in the /app directory as root. The task is to fix a broken deployment health validator script. I can see the prompt indicates there are three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml, mock_services.py (already running), and validator.py (which is broken). I need to examine these files to understand the current state and identify what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of the /app directory to confirm the files exist. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their ports, endpoints, and dependencies. After that, I'll look at the current validator.py to see what's broken. Finally, I'll test the mock services to understand their health responses.",
