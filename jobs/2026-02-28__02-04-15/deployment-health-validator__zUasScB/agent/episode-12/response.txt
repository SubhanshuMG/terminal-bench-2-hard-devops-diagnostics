I found that the worker-service returns JSON with status 'degraded' which should be considered unhealthy despite HTTP 200. The services responses are:\n- auth-service (8081): {\"status\":\"ok\"} - healthy\n- api-gateway (8082): {\"status\":\"healthy\"} - healthy  \n- cache-service (8083): \"pong\" (plain text) - healthy\n- worker-service (8084): {\"status\":\"degraded\"} - unhealthy\n- notification-service (8085): {\"status\":\"ok\"} - healthy\n\nNow I need to fix the validator.py script with all the identified issues.",
  "plan": "I'll create a fixed version of validator.py that addresses all the issues: 1) Load from deployment.services instead of top-level services, 2) Fix criticality weights, 3) Fix dependency direction in startup order, 4) Add JSON health status checking, 5) Fix critical services check to only high-criticality services.",
