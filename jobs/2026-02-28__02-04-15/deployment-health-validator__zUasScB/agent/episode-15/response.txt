  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. It correctly identified that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but status='degraded') and calculated the readiness score as 0.9. The overall status is 'degraded' because:\n- All high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy\n- The readiness score is 0.9 which is < 0.95 but >= 0.70\n- This matches the expected behavior described in the task\n\nLet me check the generated report to ensure it matches the expected schema.",
