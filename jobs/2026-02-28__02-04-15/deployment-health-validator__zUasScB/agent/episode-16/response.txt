  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema. All the key issues have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ **Manifest loading**: Now correctly loads from `deployment.services` instead of top-level `services`\n2. ✅ **Criticality weights**: Fixed weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) - readiness score is 0.9 (9 healthy units out of 10 total units)\n3. ✅ **Dependency direction**: Fixed startup order - auth-service and cache-service start first (no dependencies), then api-gateway, then worker-service, then notification-service\n4. ✅ **JSON health checking**: Correctly identifies worker-service as unhealthy despite HTTP 200 due to status='degraded'\n5. ✅ **Critical services check**: Only checks high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway), both are healthy\n\nThe report shows:\n- Overall status: 'degraded' (correct - all high-criticality services healthy but score < 0.95)\n- Readiness score: 0.9 (correct calculation)\n- Startup order: Correct topological sort\n- Critical services healthy: true (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n\nThe validator is now working correctly!",
