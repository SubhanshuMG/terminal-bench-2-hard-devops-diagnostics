  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator is now working correctly and consistently produces the expected results:\n\n1. **Fixed all identified bugs**: The validator now correctly loads from deployment.services, uses proper criticality weights, handles JSON health responses with status checking, fixes dependency direction in startup ordering, and properly checks only high-criticality services for critical status.\n\n2. **Correct behavior**: It correctly identifies worker-service as unhealthy (HTTP 200 but status='degraded'), calculates the readiness score as 0.9, and sets overall_status to 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is < 0.95.\n\n3. **Expected schema**: The generated deployment_report.json contains all required fields with correct values matching the specification.\n\n4. **Consistent results**: Running the validator multiple times produces the same correct output, confirming reliability.\n\nThe deployment health validator is now functioning properly and ready for use in the deployment pipeline.",
