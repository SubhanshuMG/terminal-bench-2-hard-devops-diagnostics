The services are: auth-service (port 8081, /health, high), api-gateway (port 8082, /health, high, depends on auth-service and cache-service), cache-service (port 8083, /ping, medium), worker-service (port 8084, /status, low, depends on api-gateway and cache-service), and notification-service (port 8085, /health, low, depends on worker-service).
