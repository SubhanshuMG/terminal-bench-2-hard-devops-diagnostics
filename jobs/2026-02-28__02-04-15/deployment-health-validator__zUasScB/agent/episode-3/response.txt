  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the current validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong manifest loading**: The `load_services()` function is loading the top-level 'services' list instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' list from the manifest.\n\n2. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels have weight=1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Wrong dependency direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the dependency graph is built incorrectly - it's adding dependencies as if they depend on the current service, when it should be the opposite.\n\n4. **Missing JSON health check**: The `check_health()` function doesn't handle JSON responses that might indicate unhealthy status despite HTTP 200.\n\n5. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking all services instead of just high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the mock services to understand their actual responses.",
