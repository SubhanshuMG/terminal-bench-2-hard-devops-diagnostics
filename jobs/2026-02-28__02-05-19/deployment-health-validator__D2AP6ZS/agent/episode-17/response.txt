  "analysis": "Excellent! The deployment report is perfect and matches the expected schema exactly. Let me verify the readiness score calculation: we have 4 healthy services out of 5. The weights are: auth-service (high=3), api-gateway (high=3), cache-service (medium=2), worker-service (low=1), notification-service (low=1). Total weight = 3+3+2+1+1 = 10. Healthy weight = 3+3+2+1 = 9. So 9/10 = 0.9, which matches the report. All requirements are met.",
