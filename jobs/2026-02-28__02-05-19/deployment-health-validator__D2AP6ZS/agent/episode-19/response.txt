  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. The validator now correctly:\n\n1. Loads the 5 deployment services from the authoritative deployment.services section\n2. Correctly identifies service health by parsing JSON responses and checking status field values\n3. Properly handles the worker-service that returns HTTP 200 but status 'degraded' (making it unhealthy)\n4. Calculates the correct readiness score using proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. Generates the correct startup order with proper topological sorting\n6. Produces a deployment report that matches the expected schema exactly\n\nThe current output shows: degraded status with 0.9 readiness score, all high-criticality services are healthy, and worker-service is correctly identified as unhealthy due to its 'degraded' status. This is the expected behavior according to the requirements.",
