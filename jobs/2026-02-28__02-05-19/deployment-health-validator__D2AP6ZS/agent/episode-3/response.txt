  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The `load_services()` function returns `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring services, not the authoritative deployment services under `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`.\n\n2. **Incorrect weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels are mapped to weight 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Missing JSON response parsing**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code but doesn't parse JSON responses to check the 'status' field for accepted values ('ok', 'up', 'healthy').\n\n4. **Startup order logic error**: The dependency graph construction is backwards - it should make dependencies point TO the services that depend on them, not FROM them.\n\nLet me first test the current broken version to see the output, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll run the current broken validator to see what it produces. Then I'll systematically fix each of the identified issues: correct service loading, fix weight mapping, add JSON response parsing, and fix the startup order logic.",
