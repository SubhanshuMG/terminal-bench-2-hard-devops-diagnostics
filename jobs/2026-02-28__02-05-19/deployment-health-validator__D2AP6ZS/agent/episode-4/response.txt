  "analysis": "As expected, the validator is broken and only finds the legacy 'metrics-collector' service instead of the 5 deployment services. The score is 0.0 because it's only checking one service. Now I need to fix the issues: load the correct services, fix the weight mapping, add JSON response parsing, and fix the startup order logic.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by: 1) Changing load_services() to return config['deployment']['services'], 2) Fixing the weight mapping to high=3, medium=2, low=1, 3) Adding JSON response parsing in check_health() to check status fields, 4) Fixing the startup order dependency graph construction. Let me create a corrected version.",
