I need to analyze the current situation and understand the deployment health validation system. Let me start by examining the files in the `/app/` directory and understanding the structure.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the `/app/` directory as root. I can see the prompt is ready for commands. I need to first explore the directory structure to understand what files are available, then examine the deployment manifest to understand the services and their configurations, and finally look at the broken validator.py file to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "My first step is to list the contents of the `/app/` directory to see what files are available. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. After that, I'll look at the mock_services.py to understand how they're set up, and finally examine the validator.py to identify what needs to be fixed.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
