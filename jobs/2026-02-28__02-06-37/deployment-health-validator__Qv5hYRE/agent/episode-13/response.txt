  "analysis": "Perfect! Now I have the complete picture of all service responses: auth-service (ok), api-gateway (healthy), cache-service (pong), worker-service (degraded - should be unhealthy), notification-service (ok). Now I need to fix the validator.py file with all the corrections: 1) Load from deployment.services instead of legacy services, 2) Fix weight map (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fix critical services check to only check high-criticality services, 4) Fix dependency graph direction, 5) Add JSON response handling for health checks.",
