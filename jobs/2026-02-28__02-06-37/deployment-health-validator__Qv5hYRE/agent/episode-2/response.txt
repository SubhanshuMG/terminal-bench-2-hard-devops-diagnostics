There are 5 services defined in the deployment.services section: auth-service (port 8081, high criticality), api-gateway (port 8082, high criticality, depends on auth-service and cache-service), cache-service (port 8083, medium criticality), worker-service (port 8084, low criticality, depends on api-gateway and cache-service), and notification-service (port 8085, low criticality, depends on worker-service).
