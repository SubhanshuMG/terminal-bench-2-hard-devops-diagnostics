All the fields are present with correct values: deployment_name, overall_status ('degraded'), readiness_score (0.9), service_statuses with all 5 services showing correct health status (worker-service correctly marked as unhealthy), startup_order is topologically sorted, critical_services_healthy is true (both high-criticality services are healthy), and timestamp is properly formatted. Let me verify the readiness score calculation manually to confirm it's correct.",
