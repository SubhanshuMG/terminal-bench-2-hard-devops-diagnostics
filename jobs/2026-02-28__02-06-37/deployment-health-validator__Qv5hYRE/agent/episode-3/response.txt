  "analysis": "I've identified several critical bugs in the validator.py file: 1) The `load_services()` function is loading the wrong services list - it's loading the legacy 'services' from the top level instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' section. 2) The weight map in `compute_readiness_score()` has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1). 3) The `determine_status()` function is checking if ALL services are healthy instead of only checking high-criticality services for the critical_ok determination. 4) The startup order algorithm has the dependency graph reversed - it's adding dependencies as neighbors instead of the other way around. 5) The health check doesn't handle JSON responses with status fields as specified in the requirements.",
  "plan": "I need to fix several bugs in the validator.py file. First, I'll test the current state by running it to see what happens, then I'll fix the critical issues one by one: correct the services loading, fix the weight map, fix the critical services check, fix the dependency graph direction, and add proper JSON response handling for health checks.",
