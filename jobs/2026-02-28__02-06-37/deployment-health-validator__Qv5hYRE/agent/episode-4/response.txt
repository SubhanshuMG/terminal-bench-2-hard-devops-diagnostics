  "analysis": "The validator is clearly broken. It's only checking the legacy 'metrics-collector' service instead of the 5 production services defined in deployment.services. The service isn't running on port 9091, so it shows as unhealthy. I can see the issues: 1) Wrong services being loaded (legacy instead of deployment.services), 2) readiness score is 0.0, 3) overall_status is 'critical'. Now I need to fix the validator.py file.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by correcting the load_services function to load from deployment.services instead of the legacy services list. I'll also check what services are actually running by testing some of the production service endpoints to understand their health responses.",
