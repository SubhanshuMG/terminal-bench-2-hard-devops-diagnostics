I need to analyze the current situation and understand the deployment health validation tool. Let me start by examining the files in the `/app/` directory and understanding the current state.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the `/app/` directory as root. I can see the terminal is ready and waiting for commands. I need to examine the three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml, mock_services.py, and validator.py to understand the current state and what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of the `/app/` directory to confirm all files are present. Then I'll examine each file to understand the services, their endpoints, and the current broken state of the validator.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": false
}
