  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is loading the wrong services list (it's using the legacy 'services' instead of 'deployment.services'), so it's only finding 'metrics-collector' which isn't running, hence the score of 0.0 and critical status. Now I need to fix the validator.py script with the issues I identified.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by: 1) Changing load_services to use deployment.services instead of services, 2) Fixing the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixing the critical_services_healthy logic to only check high-criticality services, and 4) Adding proper JSON health status checking for the 'degraded' case.",
