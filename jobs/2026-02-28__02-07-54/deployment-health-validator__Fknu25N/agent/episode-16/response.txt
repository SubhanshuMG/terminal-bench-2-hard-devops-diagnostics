  "analysis": "Good! I've successfully created the fixed validator.py. The key fixes I made are: 1) Fixed load_services to use config['deployment']['services'] instead of config['services'], 2) Fixed the weight mapping to use correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixed critical_services_healthy to only check high-criticality services, 4) Added proper JSON health status validation to handle the 'degraded' case, and 5) Fixed the startup order algorithm to properly handle dependencies. Now let me test the fixed validator.",
