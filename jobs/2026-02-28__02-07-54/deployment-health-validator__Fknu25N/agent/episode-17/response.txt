  "analysis": "Excellent! The fixed validator is working correctly. It correctly identifies that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but status 'degraded'), calculates the readiness score as 0.9000 (9 healthy services out of 10 total weighted services), and determines the overall status as 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but the score is < 0.95.
