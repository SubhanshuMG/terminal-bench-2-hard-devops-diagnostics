  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema. All the key requirements are met:\n\n1. **overall_status**: 'degraded' - correctly calculated since all high-criticality services are healthy but readiness_score (0.9) < 0.95\n2. **readiness_score**: 0.9 - correctly calculated as (3+3+2+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10 = 0.9\n3. **service_statuses**: All services correctly identified - worker-service is unhealthy due to 'degraded' status\n4. **startup_order**: Correct topological order with dependencies satisfied\n5. **critical_services_healthy**: true - both high-criticality services (auth-service, api-gateway) are healthy\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and producing the expected output.",
