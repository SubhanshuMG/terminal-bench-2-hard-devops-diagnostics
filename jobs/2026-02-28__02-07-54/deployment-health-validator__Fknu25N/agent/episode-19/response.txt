  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The deployment health validator has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. The validator now:\n\n1. **Loads the correct services**: Uses deployment.services instead of the legacy services list\n2. **Correctly identifies service health**: Worker-service is properly marked as unhealthy due to its 'degraded' JSON status despite HTTP 200\n3. **Calculates readiness score correctly**: Uses proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) resulting in 0.9 score\n4. **Determines overall status correctly**: 'degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n5. **Generates proper startup order**: Topological sort with dependencies satisfied\n6. **Correctly identifies critical services health**: true since both high-criticality services (auth-service, api-gateway) are healthy\n\nThe output consistently shows the expected behavior with the worker-service being correctly identified as unhealthy due to its 'degraded' status, which was the key issue to identify and fix according to the task requirements.",
