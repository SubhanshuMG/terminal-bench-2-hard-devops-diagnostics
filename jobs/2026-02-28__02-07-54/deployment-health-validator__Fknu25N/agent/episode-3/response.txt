  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script. The main problems are: 1) It's loading the wrong services list from the manifest (using the legacy monitoring registry instead of the authoritative deployment.services), 2) The weight mapping in compute_readiness_score has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct values (3,2,1), and 3) The critical_ok check in determine_status is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services. Let me test the current mock services first to understand their health status.",
  "plan": "I'll test each mock service to see their current health status, then fix the validator.py script. I need to: 1) Fix the load_services function to use deployment.services, 2) Fix the weight mapping, 3) Fix the critical_services_healthy logic.",
