  "analysis": "Excellent! The fixed validator is now working correctly. It successfully:\n\n1. Loaded all 5 services from the authoritative deployment.services section\n2. Correctly identified that worker-service is unhealthy (HTTP 200 but JSON status not operational)\n3. Calculated the correct readiness score (0.9 = 9/10 weighted ratio)\n4. Determined the correct overall status ('degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95)\n5. Generated the correct startup order with dependencies properly handled\n\nLet me verify the generated report matches the expected schema and then test a few edge cases.",
  "plan": "I'll examine the generated deployment_report.json to ensure it matches the expected schema, then test the health endpoints to understand why worker-service is showing as unhealthy when it returns HTTP 200.",
