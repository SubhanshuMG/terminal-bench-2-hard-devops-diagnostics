  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms that the health validation is working correctly. The worker-service returns HTTP 200 but the JSON response shows `\"status\": \"degraded\"`, which is not one of the operational states we consider healthy (['ok', 'healthy', 'up', 'operational']). This is exactly the behavior described in the requirements - a service can return HTTP 200 while reporting a degraded operational state in its body.\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and producing the expected report format. Let me run one final test to ensure it handles the case where a high-criticality service becomes unhealthy.",
