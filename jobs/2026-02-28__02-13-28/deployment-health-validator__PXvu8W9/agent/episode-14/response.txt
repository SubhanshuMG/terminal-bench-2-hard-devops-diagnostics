  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly and consistently. It successfully:\n\n1. ✅ Loads all 5 services from the authoritative 'deployment.services' section\n2. ✅ Correctly checks health by validating both HTTP status and JSON operational status\n3. ✅ Identifies worker-service as unhealthy (HTTP 200 but JSON status 'degraded')\n4. ✅ Calculates the correct readiness score (0.9 = weighted ratio 9/10)\n5. ✅ Determines the correct overall status ('degraded' since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95)\n6. ✅ Generates the correct topological startup order\n7. ✅ Produces a report that matches the exact JSON schema specified\n8. ✅ Correctly identifies that critical_services_healthy is true\n\nThe deployment health validator is now fixed and working as expected.",
