The final verification confirms that the validator is working perfectly:\n\n1. ✅ **All 5 services loaded**: Services count is 5, including all services from deployment.services\n2. ✅ **Correct readiness score**: 0.9 (calculated as (3+3+2+0+1)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 9/10)\n3. ✅ **Correct overall status**: 'degraded' (all high-criticality services healthy but score < 0.95)\n4. ✅ **Critical services healthy**: True (both high-criticality services - auth-service and api-gateway - are healthy)\n5. ✅ **All services present**: auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, worker-service, notification-service\n6. ✅ **Proper health validation**: worker-service correctly identified as unhealthy despite HTTP 200 due to 'degraded' status in JSON\n7. ✅ **Correct startup order**: Topological sort with dependencies first\n8. ✅ **Exact schema compliance**: All required fields present with correct data types\n\nThe validator is now fully functional and meets all requirements.",
