  "analysis": "I am confident the task is complete. The validator has been successfully fixed with all critical issues resolved:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed service loading to use authoritative 'deployment.services' instead of legacy 'services'\n2. ✅ Fixed weight mapping in readiness score calculation (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Fixed critical_services_healthy logic to only check high-criticality services\n4. ✅ Enhanced health check to validate JSON response body for operational status\n5. ✅ Fixed topological sort direction for proper startup ordering\n6. ✅ All 5 services are now properly processed\n7. ✅ Readiness score calculation is correct (0.9 = 9/10 weighted ratio)\n8. ✅ Overall status determination follows all rules correctly\n9. ✅ Report schema matches exactly as specified\n10. ✅ worker-service correctly identified as unhealthy despite HTTP 200 due to 'degraded' JSON status\n\nThe validator is now fully functional and produces correct deployment reports that meet all requirements.",
