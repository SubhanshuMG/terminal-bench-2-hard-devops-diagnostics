  "analysis": "Now I can see several critical issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong service loading**: The `load_services()` function is loading the top-level 'services' list instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' list from the manifest.\n\n2. **Wrong weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, the weight_map has all criticality levels set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Incorrect critical_services_healthy logic**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of only high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Missing JSON health check**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code 200 but doesn't validate the JSON response body for operational status as required.\n\n5. **Topological sort direction**: The startup order algorithm needs to be fixed - dependencies should come before their dependents.\n\nLet me test the current broken behavior first, then fix these issues.",
