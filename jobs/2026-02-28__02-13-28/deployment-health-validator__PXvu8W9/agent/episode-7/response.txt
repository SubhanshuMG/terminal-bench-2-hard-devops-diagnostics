  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only loading the legacy 'services' section (just metrics-collector) instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' section (which has all 5 services). The readiness score is 0.0 because of the wrong weight mapping, and it's showing 'critical' status incorrectly. Now I'll fix these issues systematically.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by addressing all the identified issues:\n1. Fix load_services() to load from deployment.services\n2. Fix the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score()\n3. Fix the critical_services_healthy logic to only check high-criticality services\n4. Enhance check_health() to validate JSON response body\n5. Fix the topological sort direction for startup order",
