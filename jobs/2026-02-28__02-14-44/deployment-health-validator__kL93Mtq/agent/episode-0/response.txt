  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to examine the existing files to understand the current state of the broken validator. I need to look at the deployment manifest, the mock services, and the broken validator to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the files in /app to confirm they exist, then examine each file to understand the structure and identify what's broken in the validator. I'll also test the mock services to ensure they're running properly.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
