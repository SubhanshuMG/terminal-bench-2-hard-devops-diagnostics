  "analysis": "Excellent progress! The validator is now working much better. It's correctly identifying most services as healthy, but there's still an issue with the worker-service showing as unhealthy despite HTTP 200. Looking at the score of 0.9, this suggests the weights are now correctly applied (high=3, medium=2, low=1). The status shows 'degraded' which is correct since the score is 0.9 which is < 0.95 but >= 0.70. Let me check what the worker-service endpoint returns to understand why it's marked as unhealthy.",
