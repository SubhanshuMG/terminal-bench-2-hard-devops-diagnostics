Let me verify this by checking the logic:\n\n1. **Services loaded correctly**: All 5 deployment services are loaded\n2. **Health checks work**: \n   - auth-service (high): healthy ✓\n   - api-gateway (high): healthy ✓  \n   - cache-service (medium): healthy ✓ (non-JSON, HTTP 200 sufficient)\n   - worker-service (low): unhealthy ✓ (JSON shows 'degraded' status)\n   - notification-service (low): healthy ✓\n3. **Critical services healthy**: true (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n4. **Readiness score**: 0.9 = (3+3+2)/(3+3+2+1+1) = 8/9 = 0.888... rounded to 0.9 ✓\n5. **Overall status**: 'degraded' (critical services healthy, score 0.9 < 0.95) ✓\n6. **Startup order**: Correct topological sort ✓\n\nThe validator is now working correctly according to all specifications!",
