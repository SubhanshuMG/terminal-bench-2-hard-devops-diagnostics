  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. The validator now correctly:\n\n1. **Loads the correct services**: Fixed `load_services()` to load `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` instead of the legacy monitoring services\n2. **Validates health properly**: Enhanced `check_health()` to check JSON responses for operational status (not just HTTP 200)\n3. **Uses correct weights**: Fixed `compute_readiness_score()` to use weights high=3, medium=2, low=1\n4. **Checks critical services correctly**: Fixed `determine_status()` to only check high-criticality services instead of all services\n5. **Topological sort direction**: Fixed `compute_startup_order()` to have dependencies point to dependents correctly\n\nThe validator is producing the expected output with:\n- 5 services correctly loaded and checked\n- Proper health detection (worker-service correctly marked as unhealthy due to 'degraded' JSON status)\n- Correct readiness score of 0.9\n- Correct overall status of 'degraded'\n- Proper startup order and all required fields in the JSON report",
