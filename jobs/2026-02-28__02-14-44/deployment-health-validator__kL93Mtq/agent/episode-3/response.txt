  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n1. The `load_services` function is loading the wrong section - it's loading `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment services).\n2. The `check_health` function only checks HTTP status but doesn't validate JSON responses for operational state as required.\n3. The `compute_readiness_score` has incorrect weights - all criticalities are set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n4. The `determine_status` function has a bug - it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just high-criticality services.\n5. The topological sort in `compute_startup_order` has the dependency direction backwards.",
