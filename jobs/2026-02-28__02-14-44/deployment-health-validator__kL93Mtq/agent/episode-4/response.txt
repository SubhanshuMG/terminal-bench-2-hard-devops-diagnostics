  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues. The validator is only loading the legacy 'metrics-collector' service instead of the 5 deployment services. Now I need to fix all the identified issues. Let me start by backing up the original and creating a fixed version.",
  "plan": "I'll fix all the issues systematically:\n1. Fix load_services to load the correct deployment services section\n2. Fix check_health to properly validate JSON responses for operational state\n3. Fix compute_readiness_score to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. Fix determine_status to only check high-criticality services\n5. Fix compute_startup_order dependency direction\n6. Test with the fixed version",
