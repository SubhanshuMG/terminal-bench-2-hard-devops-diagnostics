I need to start by exploring the current directory structure and examining the files mentioned in the task to understand the current state of the deployment health validator.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to examine the existing files to understand the broken validator. I need to look at the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, check if mock_services.py is running, and examine the broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of /app to see what files are available. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. After that, I'll check if the mock services are running and then examine the broken validator.py to identify the issues.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
