  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment health validator is now working correctly. Let me verify that all the key requirements are met:\n\n1. ✓ All 5 services are properly checked with correct health endpoints\n2. ✓ JSON responses are properly handled (checking operational status in response body)\n3. ✓ Weighted readiness score is calculated correctly (0.9 with proper weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✓ Topological sorting produces correct startup order based on dependencies\n5. ✓ Overall status is correctly determined as 'degraded' (all high-criticality services healthy, score 0.9 < 0.95)\n6. ✓ critical_services_healthy is correctly true (both high-criticality services are healthy)\n7. ✓ Report is generated in the correct JSON format with all required fields\n\nThe validator is now fully functional and meets all the requirements!",
