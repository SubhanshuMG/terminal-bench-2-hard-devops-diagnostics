  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment health validator is now working correctly and consistently. All issues have been resolved:\n\n✓ Fixed load_services() to read from deployment.services instead of the legacy monitoring registry\n✓ Fixed check_health() to properly handle JSON responses by checking operational status in response body\n✓ Fixed compute_readiness_score() with correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) and proper calculation\n✓ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n✓ Fixed compute_startup_order() with correct topological sorting algorithm\n✓ All 5 services are properly validated with their correct health endpoints\n✓ Report format matches the required schema exactly\n✓ Overall status correctly shows 'degraded' (all high-criticality services healthy, readiness_score 0.9)\n\nThe validator now produces the correct deployment_report.json with accurate health status, proper startup order based on dependencies, and correct overall status determination.",
