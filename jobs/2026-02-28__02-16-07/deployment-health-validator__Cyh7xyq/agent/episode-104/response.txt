  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the deployment health validator is now working correctly. Let me verify one final time by checking the generated report to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n1. All 5 services are checked with correct health endpoints\n2. JSON responses properly validate operational status (not just HTTP 200)\n3. Weighted readiness score calculated correctly (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. Topological sorting produces correct startup order based on dependencies\n5. Overall status correctly identifies 'degraded' (all high-criticality healthy, score 0.9)\n6. Report format matches schema exactly\n7. critical_services_healthy is correctly true\n\nThe validator is producing consistent, correct results and all the original bugs have been fixed.",
