  "analysis": "I can see the current check_health function is too simplistic - it only checks if the HTTP status is 200, but according to the requirements, for JSON responses I need to also check the status field in the response body. For non-JSON responses (like 'pong'), HTTP 200 is sufficient. I need to improve this logic.",
  "plan": "I need to rewrite the check_health function to properly handle both JSON and non-JSON responses. For JSON responses, I need to parse the response and check if the status field indicates an operational state. Let me create a new version of this function.",
