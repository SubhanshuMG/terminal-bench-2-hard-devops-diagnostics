However, I still need to fix several issues: 1) There's a duplicate 'import json' line, 2) The check_health function is still the old version that doesn't handle JSON responses properly, 3) I need to check if the weight mapping was fixed and if the criticality check was fixed.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the issues step by step: 1) Remove the duplicate import line, 2) Replace the check_health function with the improved version, 3) Check and fix the weight mapping and criticality check if needed.",
