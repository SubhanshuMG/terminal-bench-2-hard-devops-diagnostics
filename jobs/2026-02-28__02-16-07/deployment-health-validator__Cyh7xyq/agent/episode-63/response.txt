  "analysis": "I can see there's a problem with the compute_readiness_score function. It's incorrectly filtering for only high-criticality services (if s['criticality'] == 'high') instead of including all services. This is wrong - it should include all services but use the correct weights. Let me check the determine_status function as well and then fix both issues.",
