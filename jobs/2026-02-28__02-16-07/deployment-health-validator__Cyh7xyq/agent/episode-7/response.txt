  "analysis": "Now I can see the issues with the validator.py file. There are several problems: 1) The load_services function is reading from the wrong section - it's using the top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services', 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The determine_status function is checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just high-criticality services, 4) The health check function doesn't properly handle JSON responses that might have operational status in the body. Let me run the current broken version first to see what happens.",
  "plan": "I'll run the current validator to see its output, then fix the identified issues one by one. The main fixes needed are: correct the service loading to use deployment.services, fix the weight mapping, fix the criticality check, and improve the health check logic for JSON responses.",
