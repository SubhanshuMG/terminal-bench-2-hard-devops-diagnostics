  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only loading the 'metrics-collector' service from the legacy monitoring registry instead of the 5 services from 'deployment.services'. The readiness score is 0 because of the incorrect weight mapping, and it's showing as critical because it's only checking that one service. Now I need to fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file step by step: 1) Fix load_services to use deployment.services, 2) Fix the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score, 3) Fix the criticality check in determine_status, 4) Improve the health check to properly handle JSON responses with operational status.",
