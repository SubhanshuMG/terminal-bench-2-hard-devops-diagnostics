  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly and has generated the deployment report. However, there are a couple of issues: 1) The readiness score is 1.5 which is impossible (it should be between 0 and 1), 2) The startup order looks incorrect - api-gateway shouldn't come first since it depends on auth-service and cache-service. Let me examine the report and fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll examine the generated deployment report to see what's in it, then fix the readiness score calculation and the topological sorting logic.",
