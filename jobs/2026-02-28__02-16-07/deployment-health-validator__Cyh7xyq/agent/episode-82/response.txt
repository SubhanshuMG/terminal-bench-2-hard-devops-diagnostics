  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the report: 1) The readiness_score is 1.5 which is impossible (should be 0-1), 2) critical_services_healthy is false even though both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy, 3) The startup order is completely wrong. Let me fix the readiness score calculation first - the issue is likely in the weight calculation.",
