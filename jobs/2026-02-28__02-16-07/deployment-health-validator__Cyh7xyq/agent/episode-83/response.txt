  "analysis": "I found the problem! The compute_readiness_score function is still incorrectly filtering for only high-criticality services in the total calculation (if s['criticality'] == 'high'). This means it's only counting high-criticality services in the denominator but all services in the numerator, which explains the score of 1.5. Let me fix this.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the compute_readiness_score function to include all services in both the numerator and denominator, then check why critical_services_healthy is false when it should be true.",
