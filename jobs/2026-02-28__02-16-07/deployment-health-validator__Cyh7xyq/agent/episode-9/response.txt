  "plan": "I'll edit the validator.py file to fix the key issues: 1) Update load_services to read from 'deployment.services' instead of the top-level 'services', 2) Fix the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fix determine_status to only check high-criticality services, 4) Improve the health check logic for JSON responses.",
