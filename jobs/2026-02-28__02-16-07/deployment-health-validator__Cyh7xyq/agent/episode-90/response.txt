  "analysis": "Great progress! The readiness score is now calculated correctly at 0.9 (which makes sense since we have 4 healthy services out of 5, with proper weights). However, there are still two issues: 1) The overall_status is showing as 'critical' even though both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy, 2) The startup order still looks incorrect - api-gateway shouldn't come after worker-service since api-gateway depends on auth-service and cache-service.",
  "plan": "I need to fix the determine_status function to correctly identify that critical_services_healthy should be true since both high-criticality services are healthy. Then I need to fix the topological sorting to get the correct startup order.",
