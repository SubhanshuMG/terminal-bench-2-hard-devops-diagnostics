I need to analyze the current situation and understand the broken validator script. Let me start by examining the existing files to understand the structure and identify what needs to be fixed.

{
  "analysis": "I'm in the /app directory as root. The task is to fix a broken deployment health validator script. I need to examine the existing files: deployment_manifest.yaml (defines services), mock_services.py (simulates services), and validator.py (the broken script). The mock services are already running in the background.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of /app to see what files are available, then examine each file to understand the current state. I'll start with the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service definitions, then look at validator.py to identify the issues.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
