So the calculation is correct:\n- Healthy services: auth-service (high, weight 3), api-gateway (high, weight 3), cache-service (medium, weight 2), notification-service (low, weight 1)\n- Unhealthy services: worker-service (low, weight 1)\n- Total weight: 3+3+2+1+1 = 10\n- Healthy weight: 3+3+2+1 = 9\n- Readiness score: 9/10 = 0.9\n\nThe validator is working perfectly! All the fixes are correct.",
