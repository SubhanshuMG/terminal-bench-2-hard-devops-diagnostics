  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly. All the issues have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ **Fixed manifest loading**: Now reads from 'deployment.services' instead of top-level 'services'\n2. ✅ **Fixed weight mapping**: Correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) for readiness score calculation\n3. ✅ **Fixed critical services check**: Only checks high-criticality services, not all services\n4. ✅ **Added JSON health checking**: Properly checks JSON response body for operational status\n5. ✅ **Fixed startup order**: Correct topological sort with proper dependency direction\n\nThe validator is producing the correct report format with:\n- 4 healthy services (auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, notification-service)\n- 1 unhealthy service (worker-service, due to 'degraded' status in JSON)\n- Readiness score of 0.9 (9/10 weighted score)\n- Overall status of 'degraded' (all high-criticality services healthy, but score < 0.95)\n- Correct startup order respecting dependencies\n- All required fields in the JSON report\n\nThe deployment pipeline validator is now fixed and ready for production use.",
