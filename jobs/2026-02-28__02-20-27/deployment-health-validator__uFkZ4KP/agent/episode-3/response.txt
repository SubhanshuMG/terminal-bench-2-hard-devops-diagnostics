  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Wrong manifest loading**: The `load_services()` function reads from the top-level 'services' list (which only has metrics-collector), but it should read from 'deployment.services' which contains the actual 5 services.\n\n2. **Wrong weights in readiness score**: The `weight_map` has all criticality levels set to 1, but according to the requirements, it should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Wrong critical services check**: The `determine_status()` function checks if ALL services are healthy, but it should only check high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Missing JSON health check**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status, but doesn't check the JSON response body for operational status as required.\n\nLet me test the current broken version first to see what it produces.",
