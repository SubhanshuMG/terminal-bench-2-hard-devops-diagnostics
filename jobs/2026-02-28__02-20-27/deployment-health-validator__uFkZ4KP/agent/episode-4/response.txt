  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py script by addressing all the issues: 1) Load services from 'deployment.services', 2) Fix the weight mapping for readiness score, 3) Fix the critical services check, 4) Add JSON health checking, 5) Fix the startup order algorithm that has the dependency direction wrong.",
