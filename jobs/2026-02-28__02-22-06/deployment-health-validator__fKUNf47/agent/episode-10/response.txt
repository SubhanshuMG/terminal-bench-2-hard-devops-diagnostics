  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly! I can see:\n\n1. ✅ It's correctly loading the 5 deployment services (auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, worker-service, notification-service)\n2. ✅ Health checks are working - most services are healthy, but worker-service is showing as unhealthy despite HTTP 200 (this suggests the JSON status field checking is working)\n3. ✅ The startup order is correct with dependencies before dependents\n4. ✅ The readiness score is calculated correctly (0.9 based on weighted scoring)\n5. ✅ Overall status is 'degraded' which is correct since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n\nLet me check the generated report to make sure it matches the expected schema.",
