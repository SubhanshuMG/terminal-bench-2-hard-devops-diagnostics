  "analysis": "Excellent! The cache-service returns 'pong' as plain text (not JSON), and our validator correctly identified it as healthy with HTTP 200. This confirms that the health check logic properly handles both JSON responses (checking the status field) and non-JSON responses (relying only on HTTP status).\n\nAll the key issues have been successfully fixed:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed manifest parsing to load from `deployment.services` instead of legacy `services`\n2. ✅ Fixed health check logic to properly handle JSON status field validation\n3. ✅ Fixed weight mapping for readiness score calculation (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ Fixed critical services check to only verify high-criticality services\n5. ✅ Fixed topological sort algorithm for correct startup ordering\n6. ✅ The report schema matches exactly what was requested\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and producing accurate deployment health reports.",
