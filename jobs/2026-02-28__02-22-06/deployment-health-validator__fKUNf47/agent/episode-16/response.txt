  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The deployment health validator has been successfully fixed and is working correctly:\n\n✅ All 5 services are being properly loaded from the authoritative deployment.services section\n✅ Health checks work correctly - handles both JSON responses (checking status field) and non-JSON responses\n✅ Readiness score calculation is accurate (0.9) with correct weights\n✅ Startup order is topologically sorted correctly with dependencies before dependents\n✅ Overall status logic works correctly - shows 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n✅ The report schema matches exactly what was requested\n✅ The report is written to /app/deployment_report.json as required\n\nThe validator now correctly identifies that worker-service is unhealthy despite HTTP 200 because its JSON status shows 'degraded', and cache-service is healthy with the plain text 'pong' response. All requirements have been met.",
