  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only finding the legacy 'metrics-collector' service from the top-level 'services' section instead of the authoritative deployment.services section. It's trying to connect to port 9091 which doesn't exist, hence the 'unhealthy' status and HTTP 0. Now I need to fix all the identified issues in the validator.py file.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by addressing all the critical issues: 1) Fix manifest loading to use deployment.services, 2) Fix health check logic to properly handle JSON responses, 3) Fix weight mapping for readiness score, 4) Fix critical services check, 5) Fix topological sort algorithm.",
