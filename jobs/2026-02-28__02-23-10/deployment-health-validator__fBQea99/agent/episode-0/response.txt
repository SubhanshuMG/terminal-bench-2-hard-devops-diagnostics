I need to analyze the current situation and understand the deployment validation system. Let me start by exploring the available files and understanding the current state.

{
  "analysis": "I'm in the /app directory as root. I can see from the task description that there are three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml, mock_services.py, and validator.py. The mock services are already running in the background, and I need to fix the validator.py script to make it work correctly. I should first examine these files to understand the current implementation and identify what's broken.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the files in the current directory to confirm what's available. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, check if the mock services are actually running, and finally look at the validator.py to see what needs to be fixed.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
