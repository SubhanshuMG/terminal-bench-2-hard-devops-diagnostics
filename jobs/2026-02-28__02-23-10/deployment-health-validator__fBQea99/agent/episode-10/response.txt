  "analysis": "I see the issue! The auth-service is returning `{\"status\":\"ok\"}` but my validator is looking for `{\"status\":\"healthy\"}`. According to the health check semantics, a service is healthy when the status field reflects an operational state. 'ok' should be considered healthy. Let me fix the check_health function to accept both 'healthy' and 'ok' as healthy states.",
