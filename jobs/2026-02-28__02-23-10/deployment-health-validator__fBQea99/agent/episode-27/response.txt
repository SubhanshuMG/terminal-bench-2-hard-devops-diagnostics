  "analysis": "Excellent! The deployment report is now correctly generated and matches the expected schema perfectly. Let me verify the logic:\n\n1. **overall_status**: 'degraded' - This is correct because all high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy, but the readiness_score is 0.9 which is < 0.95.\n\n2. **readiness_score**: 0.9 - This is correct based on the weighted calculation: (3*2 + 2*1 + 1*1) / (3*2 + 2*1 + 1*2) = (6 + 2 + 1) / (6 + 2 + 2) = 9/10 = 0.9\n\n3. **critical_services_healthy**: true - Both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy.\n\n4. **startup_order**: Correctly shows the topological sort where dependencies come before dependents.\n\n5. **service_statuses**: All services are correctly categorized with their proper criticality levels.\n\nThe validator is now working correctly according to all the requirements!",
