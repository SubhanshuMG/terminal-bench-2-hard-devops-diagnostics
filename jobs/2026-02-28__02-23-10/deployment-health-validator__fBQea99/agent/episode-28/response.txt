  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is working correctly:\n\n1. ✅ **Fixed load_services()**: Now correctly reads from `deployment.services` instead of the legacy `services` section\n2. ✅ **Fixed check_health()**: Now properly validates JSON responses, accepting both 'healthy' and 'ok' as healthy states\n3. ✅ **Fixed compute_readiness_score()**: Now uses correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n4. ✅ **Fixed determine_status()**: Now correctly only checks high-criticality services for the critical_services_healthy condition\n5. ✅ **Fixed compute_startup_order()**: Now correctly builds the dependency graph with proper topological sorting\n\nThe validator is producing a correct deployment report that matches the expected schema with:\n- Proper overall_status calculation ('degraded' is correct for this state)\n- Accurate readiness_score (0.9 based on weighted calculation)\n- Correct startup_order with proper dependency ordering\n- All required fields populated correctly\n\nThe worker-service correctly shows as unhealthy because it returns `{\"status\":\"degraded\"}` which is not an operational state, and this is working as intended per the health check semantics.",
