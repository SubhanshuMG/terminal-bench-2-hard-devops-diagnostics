  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py code:\n\n1. The `load_services` function is reading the wrong part of the manifest - it's using the top-level 'services' list instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' section.\n\n2. The `check_health` function only checks HTTP status code 200, but according to the requirements, it should also check the response body for JSON responses to verify the 'status' field indicates an operational state.\n\n3. The `compute_readiness_score` function has all criticality weights set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n4. The `determine_status` function has a bug - it's checking if all services are healthy instead of just checking high-criticality services for the critical_ok condition.\n\n5. The `compute_startup_order` function has the dependency graph built incorrectly - it's adding dependencies as children instead of parents.\n\nLet me start the mock services first, then fix these issues.",
