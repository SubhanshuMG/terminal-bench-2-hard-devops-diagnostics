  "analysis": "Perfect! I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. The mathematical verification confirms that the readiness score calculation is correct (0.9), and the status logic is working as expected. All the key issues have been resolved:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed service loading from deployment.services instead of legacy services\n2. ✅ Implemented proper health checking with JSON status field validation\n3. ✅ Fixed dependency graph orientation for correct topological sorting\n4. ✅ Corrected criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. ✅ Fixed critical services check to only verify high-criticality services\n\nThe validator is now producing the correct deployment report with all required fields and proper schema validation.",
