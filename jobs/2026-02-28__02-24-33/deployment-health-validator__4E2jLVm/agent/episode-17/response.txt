  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. The validator now correctly:\n\n1. Loads services from deployment.services instead of the legacy top-level services\n2. Implements proper health checking with JSON status field validation (not just HTTP 200)\n3. Builds the dependency graph correctly for topological sorting\n4. Uses correct criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. Checks only high-criticality services for critical status determination\n6. Produces the correct report format with all required fields\n\nThe current output shows 4 out of 5 services healthy (worker-service is correctly marked unhealthy due to degraded status), readiness score of 0.9, and overall status of 'degraded' which is correct given that all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95.",
