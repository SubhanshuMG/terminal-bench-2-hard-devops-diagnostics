There are 5 services in the production-stack deployment: auth-service (high, port 8081), api-gateway (high, port 8082, depends on auth-service and cache-service), cache-service (medium, port 8083), worker-service (low, port 8084, depends on api-gateway and cache-service), and notification-service (low, port 8085, depends on worker-service).
