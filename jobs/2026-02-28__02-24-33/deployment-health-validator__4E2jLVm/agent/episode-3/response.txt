  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong services loading**: The `load_services()` function is loading from the top-level `services` key instead of `deployment.services` in the manifest.\n\n2. **Incorrect health check logic**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP status code == 200, but according to the requirements, it should also check JSON responses for the `status` field to ensure operational state.\n\n3. **Inverted dependency graph**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph is built incorrectly - dependencies should come BEFORE dependents, but the code adds edges from service to dependencies.\n\n4. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all weights are set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n5. **Incorrect critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking ALL services instead of just HIGH-criticality services.\n\nLet me test the current broken version first to see the output, then fix these issues.",
