  "analysis": "Excellent! The fixed validator is now working correctly. I can see:\n\n1. ✅ All 5 services are now loaded instead of just the legacy metrics-collector\n2. ✅ The criticality weights are working correctly (score = 0.9 instead of 0.0)\n3. ✅ The startup order is correct with dependencies first\n4. ✅ JSON health parsing is working (note worker-service shows unhealthy despite HTTP 200, meaning it correctly parsed a degraded JSON status)\n5. ✅ Critical services check is working (overall_status = 'degraded' because all high-crit services are healthy but score < 0.95)\n\nLet me check the generated report to verify it matches the expected schema.",
