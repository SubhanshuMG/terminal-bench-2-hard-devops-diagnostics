  "analysis": "Let me verify one more time that all requirements are met and the validator is working correctly:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to load from deployment.services instead of top-level services\n2. ✅ Fixed criticality weights: high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. ✅ Fixed topological sort direction so dependencies come before dependents\n4. ✅ Added JSON health parsing to check status field in JSON responses\n5. ✅ Fixed critical services check to only check high-criticality services\n6. ✅ Generated report matches expected schema with all required fields\n7. ✅ Readiness score calculation is correct (0.9)\n8. ✅ Overall status logic is correct ('degraded' because score < 0.95 but all high-crit services healthy)\n9. ✅ All 5 services are properly evaluated\n10. ✅ Report is written to /app/deployment_report.json\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and produces the expected output. All the original bugs have been fixed.",
