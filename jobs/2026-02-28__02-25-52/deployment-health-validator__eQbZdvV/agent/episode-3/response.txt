  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The `load_services()` function loads from the top-level `services` list instead of the authoritative `deployment.services` section.\n2. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels have weight 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n3. **Wrong startup order logic**: The topological sort has the dependency direction backwards - it should make dependencies come before their dependents.\n4. **Missing JSON health check**: The `check_health()` function only checks HTTP 200 but doesn't parse JSON responses to check the actual operational status.\n5. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it checks all services instead of just high-criticality services.\n\nLet me first test the current broken validator to see what it produces, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll run the current broken validator to see what output it produces. Then I'll fix the issues one by one: correct the services loading, fix the criticality weights, fix the topological sort, add JSON health parsing, and fix the critical services check.",
