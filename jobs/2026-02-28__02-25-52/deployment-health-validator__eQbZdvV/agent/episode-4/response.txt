  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only checking the 'metrics-collector' service from the top-level legacy services section instead of the 5 services from deployment.services. It can't connect to metrics-collector (HTTP 0), so it's giving a score of 0.0 and critical status. Now let me check if the mock services are actually running and then fix the validator.",
  "plan": "I'll first verify the mock services are running by testing a few endpoints, then fix the validator.py by: 1) Loading services from deployment.services instead of top-level services, 2) Fixing criticality weights, 3) Fixing topological sort direction, 4) Adding JSON health parsing, 5) Fixing critical services check.",
