I need to start by examining the current state of the files to understand the broken validator. Let me first explore the directory structure and examine the key files.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory as root. I need to examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, look at the mock_services.py to understand how services are simulated, and then examine the broken validator.py to identify what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of /app to confirm the files are there, then examine each file to understand the current state and identify what needs to be fixed in the validator.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
