  "analysis": "Great! The validator is now working much better. It's correctly loading all 5 services and checking their health. However, I notice a few issues:\n1. The startup order seems wrong - it should be topologically sorted so dependencies come before dependents\n2. The worker-service is showing as unhealthy despite HTTP 200, which suggests my JSON parsing might be too strict\n\nLet me check the actual response from worker-service and fix the topological sort.",
  "plan": "I'll check what the worker-service is actually returning, then fix the topological sort algorithm which seems to have the logic reversed, and adjust the health check to be more lenient for JSON responses.",
