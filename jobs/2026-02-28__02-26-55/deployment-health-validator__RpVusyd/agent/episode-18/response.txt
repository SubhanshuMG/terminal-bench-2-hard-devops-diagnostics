  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed and is now working correctly:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to load from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy top-level services\n2. ✅ Fixed weight_map in compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical status\n4. ✅ Enhanced check_health() to properly parse JSON responses and handle both JSON and plain text responses\n5. ✅ Fixed topological sort algorithm to correctly order dependencies before dependents\n6. ✅ All 5 services are correctly detected and health-checked\n7. ✅ The report is generated with the correct schema and all required fields\n8. ✅ The readiness score (1.0), overall status (healthy), and topological order are all correct\n\nThe validator now produces the expected deployment_report.json that matches the required schema exactly.",
