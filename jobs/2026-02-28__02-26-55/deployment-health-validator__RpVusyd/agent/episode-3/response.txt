  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues with the validator.py:\n\n1. It loads from the wrong part of the manifest - it's loading from the top-level 'services' instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services'\n2. The weight_map in compute_readiness_score has all weights set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. The determine_status function checks if ALL services are healthy instead of just HIGH criticality services\n4. The check_health function doesn't handle JSON responses properly - it only checks HTTP status, not the actual health status in the response body\n\nLet me test the current broken state first, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test the current broken validator to see the output, then I'll fix the issues one by one: loading the correct services, fixing the weight calculation, fixing the criticality check, and adding proper JSON response handling.",
