All the fixes are in place:\n1. ✅ load_services() now loads from config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]\n2. ✅ weight mapping is correct (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ critical_ok only checks high-criticality services\n4. ✅ JSON health checking is implemented\n5. ✅ Dependency graph construction is fixed\n\nNow let me test the fixed validator to see if it works correctly.",
