The validator is now working correctly:\n\n1. ✅ It's checking all 5 services instead of just the 1 legacy service\n2. ✅ The health checks are working (most services are healthy, worker-service is unhealthy)\n3. ✅ The startup order is correct based on dependencies\n4. ✅ The readiness score is calculated correctly (0.9000)\n5. ✅ The overall status is 'degraded' which is correct since all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95\n\nLet me check the generated report to make sure it's properly formatted according to the expected schema.",
