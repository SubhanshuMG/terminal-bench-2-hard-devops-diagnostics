  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly and consistently. All issues have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed load_services() to load the correct 5 services from deployment.services\n2. ✅ Fixed weight mapping (high=3, medium=2, low=1) for readiness score calculation\n3. ✅ Fixed dependency graph construction for proper topological sorting\n4. ✅ Added JSON health status checking for services that return JSON responses\n5. ✅ Fixed critical services check to only validate high-criticality services\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Checks all 5 services\n- Calculates the readiness score as 0.9 (90%)\n- Identifies the overall status as 'degraded' (all high-criticality services healthy, but score < 0.95)\n- Generates the proper JSON report with all required fields\n- Determines the correct startup order based on dependencies",
