  "analysis": "Excellent! This confirms that the JSON health checking logic is working perfectly. The worker-service returns HTTP 200 with JSON containing `\"status\":\"degraded\"`, which is correctly identified as unhealthy by our validator since 'degraded' is not in the list of operational states ['ok', 'healthy', 'up', 'running'].\n\nThe validator is now completely fixed and working as intended:\n- ✅ Loads all 5 services from deployment.services\n- ✅ Correctly weights services (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n- ✅ Handles JSON health responses properly\n- ✅ Calculates readiness score correctly (0.9)\n- ✅ Determines proper startup order via topological sort\n- ✅ Correctly identifies overall status as 'degraded'\n- ✅ Generates the required JSON report format\n\nThe task is complete and the deployment pipeline should now work correctly.",
