All services are healthy with HTTP 200 responses\n3. The startup order is correct: auth-service -> cache-service -> api-gateway -> worker-service -> notification-service\n4. The readiness score is 1.0000 (perfect score since all services are healthy)\n5. The overall status is 'healthy' since all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95\n\nLet me verify the generated report file to ensure it matches the expected schema.",
