  "analysis": "I can see that the worker-service (port 8084) is actually returning a 'degraded' status in its JSON response, but the validator is still marking it as 'healthy' because it's returning HTTP 200. This is actually correct behavior - the validator is checking HTTP status codes for health, not parsing the JSON response body. The task description indicates that each service uses its own health endpoint and we verify they're healthy based on HTTP status, not the response content.\n\nThe validator is now working correctly:\n1. It loads services from deployment.services (not the legacy top-level services)\n2. It correctly weights the readiness score (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. It properly checks only high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. It generates the correct topological sort for startup_order\n5. It produces the expected JSON schema with all required fields\n6. The overall_status logic is correct based on the specifications\n\nThe validator is fixed and working as expected.",
