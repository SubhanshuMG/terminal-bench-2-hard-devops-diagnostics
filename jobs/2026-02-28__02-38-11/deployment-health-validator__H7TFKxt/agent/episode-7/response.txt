  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py file that need to be fixed:\n\n1. The `load_services` function is loading from the wrong section - it's loading from the top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services' in the manifest.\n2. The weight_map in `compute_readiness_score` has all weights set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n3. The `determine_status` function is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for the critical_ok calculation.\n4. The topological sort in `compute_startup_order` has the dependency direction wrong - it should add edges from dependencies to dependents, not the other way around.\n\nLet me run the current broken version first to see what it produces, then fix these issues.",
