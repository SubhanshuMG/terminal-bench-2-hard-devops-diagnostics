  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues. The validator is only loading the 'metrics-collector' from the top-level services section instead of the 5 services from deployment.services. It's also showing a score of 0.0 because of the incorrect weight mapping. Let me fix these issues step by step.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by: 1) Fixing load_services to use deployment.services, 2) Fixing the weight mapping in compute_readiness_score, 3) Fixing the critical_ok logic in determine_status to only check high-criticality services, 4) Fixing the topological sort direction in compute_startup_order.",
