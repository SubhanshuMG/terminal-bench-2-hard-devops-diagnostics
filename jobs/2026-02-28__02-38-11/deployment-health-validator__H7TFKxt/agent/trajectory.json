      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Deployment Health Validator \u2014 Debug Task\n\nYou are a DevOps engineer onboarding to a microservices team. The previous engineer left behind a deployment health validation tool that is **broken**. Your job is to fix it so the deployment pipeline works correctly.\n\n## Context\n\nThe production stack has five services with dependencies between them. Before any deployment, a validator checks all services are healthy and computes a readiness report.\n\nThe following files exist in `/app/`:\n\n- **`/app/deployment_manifest.yaml`** \u2014 Defines all services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels.\n- **`/app/mock_services.py`** \u2014 Simulates the five service health endpoints (already running in the background).\n- **`/app/validator.py`** \u2014 The main validation script. **It is currently broken and needs to be fixed.**\n\nThe mock services are already running. You can verify them manually with `curl`, for example:\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8081/health\n```\n\n## Objective\n\nFix `/app/validator.py` so that running:\n\n```\npython /app/validator.py\n```\n\nproduces a correct report at `/app/deployment_report.json`.\n\n## Expected Report Schema\n\n```json\n{\n  \"deployment_name\": \"production-stack\",\n  \"overall_status\": \"healthy|degraded|critical|not_ready\",\n  \"readiness_score\": 0.0,\n  \"service_statuses\": {\n    \"service-name\": {\n      \"status\": \"healthy|unhealthy\",\n      \"http_status\": 200,\n      \"criticality\": \"high|medium|low\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"startup_order\": [\"service-name\", \"...\"],\n  \"critical_services_healthy\": true,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"\n}\n```\n\n## Definitions\n\n**`overall_status`**:\n- `healthy` \u2014 all high-criticality services healthy AND readiness_score >= 0.95\n- `degraded` \u2014 all high-criticality services healthy AND readiness_score < 0.95\n- `critical` \u2014 one or more **high**-criticality services are unhealthy\n- `not_ready` \u2014 readiness_score < 0.70 (regardless of criticality)\n\n**`readiness_score`** \u2014 weighted fraction of healthy services:\n- `high` criticality \u2192 weight **3**\n- `medium` criticality \u2192 weight **2**\n- `low` criticality \u2192 weight **1**\n- Formula: `sum(weight for healthy services) / sum(weight for all services)`\n\n**`startup_order`** \u2014 topologically sorted service names; every dependency must appear **before** its dependent in the list.\n\n**`critical_services_healthy`** \u2014 `true` if and only if every service with criticality `\"high\"` is currently healthy.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Each service uses its own health endpoint (not always `/health`) \u2014 check the manifest.\n- Use `curl` to probe each endpoint and verify the actual responses before assuming they are healthy.\n- Fix only `/app/validator.py`. Do not modify `mock_services.py` or `deployment_manifest.yaml`.\n- The report must be written to `/app/deployment_report.json`.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c7949bce9f95:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
