The report contains:\n\n1. ✅ All 5 services with correct health status (all healthy)\n2. ✅ Correct criticality levels (high, high, medium, low, low)\n3. ✅ Correct startup order based on dependencies\n4. ✅ Readiness score of 1.0 (100% - all services healthy)\n5. ✅ Overall status of 'healthy' (all high-criticality services healthy + score >= 0.95)\n6. ✅ Critical_services_healthy is true\n7. ✅ Correct timestamp format\n8. ✅ All required fields in the expected schema\n\nLet me test one more scenario to verify the validator handles unhealthy services correctly by temporarily stopping one service.",
