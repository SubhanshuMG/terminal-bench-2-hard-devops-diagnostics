  "analysis": "Let me verify one more time that the validator is completely fixed by checking all the key requirements:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed service loading - now loads from deployment.services instead of services\n2. ✅ Fixed weight mapping - now uses high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. ✅ Fixed critical services check - now only checks high-criticality services\n4. ✅ Fixed dependency direction - topological sort now correctly orders dependencies first\n5. ✅ All 5 services are being checked and reported\n6. ✅ Startup order is correct based on dependencies\n7. ✅ Readiness score calculation is correct using weighted formula\n8. ✅ Overall status determination follows the rules exactly\n9. ✅ Report is written to /app/deployment_report.json with correct schema\n10. ✅ All mock services are healthy so score=1.0 and status=healthy\n\nThe validator is working perfectly and meets all the requirements.",
