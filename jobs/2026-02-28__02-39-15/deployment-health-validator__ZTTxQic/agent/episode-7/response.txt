  "analysis": "I can see several critical bugs in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong service configuration**: The `load_services()` function is loading from the top-level `services` key, but according to the manifest, the authoritative services are under `deployment.services`. The top-level services only contains a legacy metrics-collector service.\n\n2. **Wrong weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, the weight_map has all criticality levels set to 1, but according to the requirements, it should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, the `critical_ok` check is looking at ALL services being healthy, but it should only check high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Wrong dependency direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph construction is backwards - it's adding dependencies as if services depend on their dependents, but dependencies should come before dependents.\n\nLet me run the current validator to see what it produces, then fix these issues.",
