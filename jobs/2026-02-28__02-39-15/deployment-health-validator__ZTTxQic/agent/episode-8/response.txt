  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the bugs I identified. The validator is only checking the legacy 'metrics-collector' service (which isn't running) instead of the 5 production services. The score is 0.0 because it's using wrong weights, and the status is 'critical' because it's not properly checking high-criticality services. Let me check the generated report and then fix the validator.",
  "plan": "I'll first check the generated report to see the current broken output, then fix the validator.py by correcting the service loading, weight mapping, critical services logic, and dependency direction.",
