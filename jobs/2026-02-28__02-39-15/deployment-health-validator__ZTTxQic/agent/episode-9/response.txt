  "analysis": "Exactly as expected - the report only contains the legacy metrics-collector service instead of the 5 production services. Now I need to fix the validator.py. I'll make a copy first for safety, then fix the key bugs: correct service loading, fix weight mapping, fix critical services logic, and fix dependency direction.",
  "plan": "I'll backup the original validator, then create a fixed version that addresses all the identified issues: 1) Load services from 'deployment.services' instead of 'services', 2) Fix weight mapping to high=3, medium=2, low=1, 3) Fix critical services check to only look at high-criticality services, 4) Fix dependency direction in topological sort.",
