  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment health validator is now working correctly and consistently. All issues have been fixed:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed `load_services()` to load `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` instead of `config[\"services\"]`\n2. ✅ Fixed `compute_readiness_score()` weight_map to use correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✅ Fixed `determine_status()` to only check high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. ✅ Fixed `compute_startup_order()` to correct the dependency direction in the topological sort\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Checks all 5 deployment services\n- Produces the correct readiness score (1.0 when all services are healthy)\n- Generates the correct startup order based on dependencies\n- Sets the appropriate overall_status based on the rules\n- Outputs a properly formatted JSON report to `/app/deployment_report.json`",
