  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. The validator.py script has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. All the issues identified have been resolved:\n\n1. The `load_services()` function now correctly loads the deployment services from `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` instead of the legacy services.\n2. The `compute_readiness_score()` function now uses the correct weight mapping (high=3, medium=2, low=1) for the readiness score calculation.\n3. The `determine_status()` function now correctly checks only high-criticality services to determine if critical_services_healthy.\n4. The `compute_startup_order()` function now has the correct dependency direction in the topological sort.\n\nThe validator successfully checks all 5 deployment services, produces the correct readiness score (1.0), generates the proper startup order, and outputs a valid JSON report that matches the expected schema. I have verified this by running the validator multiple times and examining the output.",
