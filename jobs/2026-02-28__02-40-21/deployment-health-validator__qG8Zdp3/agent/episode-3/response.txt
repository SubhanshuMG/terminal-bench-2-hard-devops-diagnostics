  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script:\n\n1. The `load_services()` function is loading the wrong section - it's loading `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring registry) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment configuration).\n\n2. The weight_map in `compute_readiness_score()` has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. The `determine_status()` function has incorrect logic - it's checking `for s in services` instead of filtering for high-criticality services to determine if critical services are healthy.\n\n4. The topological sort in `compute_startup_order()` has the dependency direction backwards - it's adding dependencies as children instead of parents.\n\nLet me test the current state first to confirm it's broken, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test the current validator to confirm it's broken. Then I'll fix the issues one by one: correct the services loading, fix the weight_map, fix the critical services check, and fix the topological sort direction.",
