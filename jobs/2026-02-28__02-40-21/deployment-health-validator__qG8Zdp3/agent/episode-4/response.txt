  "analysis": "Confirmed! The validator is broken as expected. It's only checking the 'metrics-collector' service from the legacy monitoring registry instead of the 5 deployment services. Let me test one of the actual services to verify they're running, then fix the issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test a couple of the actual deployment services to verify they're working. Then I'll fix the validator.py by correcting: 1) Load the deployment services instead of legacy services, 2) Fix the weight_map for readiness score, 3) Fix the critical services check logic, 4) Fix the topological sort dependency direction.",
