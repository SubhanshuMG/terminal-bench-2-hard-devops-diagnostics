  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong service source**: The `load_services()` function reads from `config[\"services\"]` (the legacy monitoring section) instead of `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` (the authoritative deployment section).\n\n2. **Incorrect weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, the weight_map has all criticality levels set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1 as specified.\n\n3. **Incorrect critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, the critical_ok check is testing all services instead of only high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Topological sort direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph construction has dependencies pointing the wrong way - dependencies should be added as predecessors, not successors.\n\nLet me run the current broken version first to see the output, then fix these issues.",
