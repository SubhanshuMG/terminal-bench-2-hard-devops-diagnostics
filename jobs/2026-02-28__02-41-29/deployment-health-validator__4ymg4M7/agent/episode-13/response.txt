  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues. The validator is only loading the legacy 'metrics-collector' service from the top-level 'services' section instead of the 5 services from 'deployment.services'. The score is 0.0 because the weights are all 1 and the single service is unhealthy. Now I'll fix all the identified issues.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by correcting:\n1. Load services from config['deployment']['services'] instead of config['services']\n2. Fix the weight mapping to high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. Fix the critical services check to only check high-criticality services\n4. Fix the topological sort direction\n\nI'll edit the file to make these corrections.",
