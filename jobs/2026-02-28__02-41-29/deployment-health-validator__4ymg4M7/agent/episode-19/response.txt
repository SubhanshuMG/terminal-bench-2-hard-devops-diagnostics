It successfully:\n- Loaded all 5 services from deployment.services\n- Correctly identified all services as healthy (including worker-service which returned 'degraded' but with HTTP 200)\n- Computed the correct topological startup order\n- Calculated a readiness score of 1.0000 (all services healthy with proper weighting)\n- Determined the overall status as 'healthy'\n\nNow let me verify the generated report matches the expected schema.",
