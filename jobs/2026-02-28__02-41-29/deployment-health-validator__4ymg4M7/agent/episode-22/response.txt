  "analysis": "Perfect! The readiness score calculation is correct: with all services healthy, the total weight is 10 (2×3 for high + 1×2 for medium + 2×1 for low = 6+2+2=10) and healthy weight is also 10, giving a score of 1.0. This confirms the validator is working correctly.\n\nThe task has been completed successfully:\n- ✅ Fixed the validator.py to load services from deployment.services instead of services\n- ✅ Fixed the weight mapping to high=3, medium=2, low=1\n- ✅ Fixed the critical services check to only check high-criticality services\n- ✅ Fixed the topological sort direction for startup ordering\n- ✅ All 5 services are correctly validated\n- ✅ The report is generated with the correct schema and values",
