All services are healthy, the startup order is correct (auth-service and cache-service first since they have no dependencies, then api-gateway which depends on both, then worker-service which depends on api-gateway and cache-service, and finally notification-service which depends on worker-service), and the readiness score is 1.0 with an overall status of 'healthy'.
