  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed all the critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed service loading - now loads from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy monitoring registry\n2. ✅ Fixed weight mapping - now correctly maps high=3, medium=2, low=1 for readiness score calculation\n3. ✅ Fixed critical services check - now only checks high-criticality services instead of all services\n4. ✅ Fixed topological sort - now correctly builds dependency graph with dependencies pointing to services that depend on them\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Loads the 5 services from the deployment manifest\n- Checks all health endpoints (including different ones like /ping for cache-service)\n- Computes the correct readiness score of 1.0 with proper weighting\n- Generates the correct startup order based on dependencies\n- Produces a valid deployment report at /app/deployment_report.json with the correct schema\n- Shows overall_status as 'healthy' with all high-criticality services healthy\n\nAll requirements have been met and the deployment pipeline validation tool is now working correctly.",
