  "analysis": "Now I understand the service architecture. There are 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. I can see that services like auth-service and api-gateway are high criticality, cache-service is medium, and worker-service and notification-service are low. The dependencies create a specific startup order. Now I need to examine the validator.py to see what's broken.",
  "plan": "I'll examine the validator.py file to understand the current implementation and identify what needs to be fixed. Then I'll test the mock services to ensure they're responding correctly before fixing the validator.",
