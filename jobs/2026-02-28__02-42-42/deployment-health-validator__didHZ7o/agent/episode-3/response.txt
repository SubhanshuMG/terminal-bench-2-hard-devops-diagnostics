  "analysis": "I've identified several critical issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong services list**: The `load_services()` function returns `config[\"services\"]` which is the legacy monitoring registry, not the authoritative deployment services under `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`.\n\n2. **Incorrect weight mapping**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels are mapped to weight 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Incorrect critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Topological sort direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the dependency graph is built backwards - it should make dependencies point TO the service that depends on them, not FROM the service.\n\nLet me first test the mock services to ensure they're working, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test a few mock service endpoints to ensure they're responding correctly. Then I'll fix the four4 major issues in the validator.py file and test the corrected version.",
