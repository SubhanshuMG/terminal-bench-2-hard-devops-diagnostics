  "analysis": "Perfect! The cache-service endpoint is also working correctly, returning 'pong' as expected. The validator has been successfully fixed and is now working as intended. All the issues have been resolved: 1) The load_services function now correctly reads from deployment.services, 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score uses the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The determine_status function now only checks high-criticality services for critical_ok, and 4) The topological sort graph construction has been fixed to correctly handle dependencies.",
