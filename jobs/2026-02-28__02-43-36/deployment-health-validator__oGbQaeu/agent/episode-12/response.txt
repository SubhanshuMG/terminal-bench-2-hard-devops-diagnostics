  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed all the issues in the validator.py file: 1) Fixed load_services() to read from deployment.services instead of the top-level services, 2) Fixed the weight_map in compute_readiness_score() to use correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixed determine_status() to only check high-criticality services for critical_ok, and 4) Fixed the topological sort graph construction. The validator now correctly produces a deployment report that matches the expected schema format, with all services healthy, correct startup order, proper readiness score calculation, and appropriate overall status determination.",
  "plan": "The deployment health validator is now fully functional and ready for use in the deployment pipeline. It will correctly validate service health, compute readiness scores, determine startup order, and generate the required JSON report.",
