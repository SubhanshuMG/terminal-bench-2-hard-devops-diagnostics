The authoritative configuration is under 'deployment.services'. I can see the services are: auth-service (port 8081, /health, high), api-gateway (port 8082, /health, high), cache-service (port 8083, /ping, medium), worker-service (port 8084, /status, low), and notification-service (port 8085, /health, low). Now I need to examine the validator.py to see what's broken.",
