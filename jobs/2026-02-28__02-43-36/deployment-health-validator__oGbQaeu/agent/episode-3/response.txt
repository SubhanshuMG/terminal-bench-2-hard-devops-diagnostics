  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py code. The main problems are: 1) The load_services function is reading the wrong section - it's reading 'services' from the top level instead of 'deployment.services', 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score has all values set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The determine_status function is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for the critical_ok calculation, and 4) The topological sort graph construction has the dependencies reversed. Let me also verify the mock services are running.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test that the mock services are actually running by checking a few endpoints. Then I'll fix the validator.py issues one by one: fix the load_services to read from deployment.services, fix the weight_map to use correct weights, fix the critical_ok logic to only check high-criticality services, and fix the topological sort graph construction.",
