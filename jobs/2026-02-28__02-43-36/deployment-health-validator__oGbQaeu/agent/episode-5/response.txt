  "analysis": "Great! The mock services are now running on all the expected ports. I can see all five services have started: auth-service (8081), api-gateway (8082), cache-service (8083), worker-service (8084), and notification-service (8085).

  "plan": "I'll test a couple of endpoints to make sure the mock services are working correctly, then proceed to fix the validator.py file. I'll fix the four main issues: load_services function, weight_map in readiness score, critical_ok logic, and topological sort graph construction.",
