  "analysis": "Perfect! The mock services are working and responding correctly. I can see the auth-service is returning a 200 response with a JSON payload indicating it's healthy. Now I need to fix the validator.py file. The main issues I identified are: 1) load_services() is reading from the wrong section (top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services'), 2) The weight_map in compute_readiness_score() has incorrect weights (all set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The determine_status() function is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for critical_ok, and 4) The topological sort has the dependency graph constructed incorrectly.",
  "plan": "I'll create a backup of the original validator.py, then fix each issue systematically. I'll start by fixing the load_services function to read from deployment.services, then fix the weight_map, fix the critical_ok logic, and finally fix the topological sort graph construction.",
