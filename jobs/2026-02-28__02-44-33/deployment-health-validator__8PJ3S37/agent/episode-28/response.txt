  "analysis": "Excellent! The deployment health validator is now working perfectly. The report shows:\n\n- All 5 services are correctly loaded and health-checked\n- All services are healthy with HTTP 200 responses\n- The readiness_score is 1.0 (100%) with correct weighted calculation\n- The overall_status is 'healthy' (all high-criticality services healthy and score >= 0.95)\n- The startup_order correctly shows the topological dependency order\n- critical_services_healthy is true (all high-criticality services are healthy)\n- The timestamp is in the correct ISO format\n\nAll the issues have been successfully fixed:\n1. ✓ Fixed services loading from deployment.services instead of top-level services\n2. ✓ Fixed weights in readiness score calculation (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. ✓ Fixed critical_ok logic to only check high-criticality services\n4. ✓ Fixed dependency direction in topological sort\n\nThe validator now correctly produces a deployment report that matches the expected schema.",
