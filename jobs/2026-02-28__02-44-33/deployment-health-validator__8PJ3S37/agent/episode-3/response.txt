  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The `load_services()` function loads from the top-level `services` key, but it should load from `deployment.services` which contains the authoritative service definitions.\n\n2. **Incorrect weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels are set to weight 1, but they should be high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Incorrect critical_ok logic**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just checking high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Wrong dependency direction**: In the topological sort, the dependencies are being added in the wrong direction - dependencies should appear before their dependents in the startup order.\n\nLet me test the current state first to see the actual behavior, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test the current validator to see what it produces, then I'll fix the issues one by one. Let me check if the mock services are running and then run the current validator to see the output.",
