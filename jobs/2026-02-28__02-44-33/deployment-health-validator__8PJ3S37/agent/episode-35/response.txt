  "analysis": "Perfect! I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator and verified it works correctly in different scenarios:\n\n1. ✓ **Services Loading**: Fixed to load from deployment.services instead of top-level services\n2. ✓ **Readiness Score Weights**: Fixed to use high=3, medium=2, low=1 weights\n3. ✓ **Critical Services Check**: Fixed to only check high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. ✓ **Topological Sort**: Fixed dependency direction so dependencies come before dependents\n5. ✓ **Status Logic**: Verified correct behavior for healthy, critical, and all intermediate states\n\nThe validator now:\n- Correctly loads all 5 services from the deployment configuration\n- Properly checks health endpoints for each service\n- Calculates the correct weighted readiness score\n- Determines the correct startup order based on dependencies\n- Reports the correct overall status based on the business rules\n- Generates a valid JSON report matching the expected schema\n\nThe task is complete and the validator is working as expected.",
