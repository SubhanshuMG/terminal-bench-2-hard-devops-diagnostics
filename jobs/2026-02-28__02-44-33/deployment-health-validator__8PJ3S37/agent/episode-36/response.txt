  "analysis": "I am confident that the deployment health validator has been successfully fixed. I have addressed all the critical issues:\n\n1. **Services Loading**: Fixed load_services() to correctly load from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy top-level 'services' key\n2. **Readiness Score Weights**: Fixed the weight_map in compute_readiness_score() to use the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) instead of all weights being 1\n3. **Critical Services Check**: Fixed the critical_ok logic in determine_status() to only check high-criticality services instead of all services\n4. **Topological Sort**: Fixed the dependency direction in compute_startup_order() so that dependencies appear before their dependents in the startup order\n\nI have verified the solution works correctly:\n- All 5 services are properly loaded and health-checked\n- The readiness score calculation uses correct weighted values\n- The startup order follows proper dependency topology\n- Status determination correctly handles healthy, critical, and other states\n- The output JSON matches the expected schema exactly\n\nThe validator now produces correct deployment reports as required.",
