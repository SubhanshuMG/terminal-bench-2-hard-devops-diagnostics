  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the main issue - the validator is only loading the legacy 'metrics-collector' service from the top-level 'services' key instead of the authoritative services from 'deployment.services'. The metrics-collector service is not running, so it's showing as unhealthy. Now I need to fix the validator.py file to address all the issues I identified.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py file by: 1) Loading services from deployment.services instead of the top-level services, 2) Fixing the weights in compute_readiness_score (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixing the critical_ok logic to only check high-criticality services, 4) Fixing the dependency direction in the topological sort.",
