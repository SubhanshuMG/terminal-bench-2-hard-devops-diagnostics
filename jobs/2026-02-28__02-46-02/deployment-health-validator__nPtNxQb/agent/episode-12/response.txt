  "analysis": "Excellent! Now the validator is correctly loading and checking all 5 services. However, I can see there are still issues:\n\n1. The startup order is wrong - it should be topologically sorted so dependencies come before dependents. The current order shows notification-service first, but it depends on worker-service.\n\n2. The readiness score is 1.0000 because the criticality weights are still set to 1 for all services (high should be 3, medium 2, low 1).\n\n3. The overall status shows 'healthy' but we need to verify this is correct based on the actual criticality logic.\n\nLet me check the current report and then fix the remaining issues.",
  "plan": "I'll first check the generated report to see the current state, then fix the criticality weights in the readiness score calculation, and finally fix the startup order algorithm.",
