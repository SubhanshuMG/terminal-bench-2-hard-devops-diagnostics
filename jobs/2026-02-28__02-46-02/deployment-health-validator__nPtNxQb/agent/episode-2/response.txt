  "analysis": "Perfect! I can see the deployment manifest clearly defines 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. The services are: auth-service (8081/high), api-gateway (8082/high), cache-service (8083/medium), worker-service (8084/low), and notification-service (8085/low). Now let me check if the mock services are actually running by testing one of the health endpoints.",
