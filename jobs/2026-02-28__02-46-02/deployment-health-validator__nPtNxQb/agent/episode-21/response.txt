  "analysis": "Excellent! The startup order is now correct. We can see:\n- auth-service and cache-service (no dependencies) come first\n- api-gateway (depends on auth and cache) comes next\n- worker-service (depends on api and cache) comes after api-gateway\n- notification-service (depends on worker) comes last\n\nThe readiness score is still 1.0000 because all services are healthy. Let me check if there are any other issues by examining the critical_services_healthy logic. I noticed earlier that the determine_status function might be checking all services instead of just high-criticality services.",
  "plan": "I'll check the current report to verify everything looks correct, then examine the determine_status function to ensure the critical_services_healthy logic is working properly.",
