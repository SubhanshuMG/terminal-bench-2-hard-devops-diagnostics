  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment health validator is now fully functional and working correctly. All the critical bugs have been fixed:\n\n✅ **Fixed service loading**: Now correctly reads from `deployment.services` instead of the legacy `services`\n✅ **Fixed criticality weights**: High=3, Medium=2, Low=1 for proper readiness score calculation\n✅ **Fixed startup order**: Correct topological sort with dependencies before dependents\n✅ **Fixed critical services check**: Only checks high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway)\n✅ **Correct report format**: Matches the expected JSON schema exactly\n\nThe validator now produces the correct deployment report with all services healthy, proper readiness score of 1.0, correct startup order, and overall status of 'healthy'. The deployment pipeline validation tool is now ready for production use.",
