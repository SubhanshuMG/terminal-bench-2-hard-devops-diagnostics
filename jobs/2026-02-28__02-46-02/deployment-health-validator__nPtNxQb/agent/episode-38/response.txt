  "analysis": "I found a critical bug! The compute_readiness_score function is incorrectly filtering for only high-criticality services (`if s[\"criticality\"] == \"high\"`) in both the total and healthy calculations. This means it's only considering high-criticality services for the readiness score, ignoring medium and low services entirely. This is wrong - the readiness score should consider ALL services with their respective weights.",
  "plan": "I need to fix the compute_readiness_score function to remove the filtering and include all services in the calculation. The weights should be applied to all services, not just high-criticality ones.",
