  "analysis": "Perfect! After comprehensive verification, the deployment health validator is now working correctly:\n\n✅ **All 5 services checked**: auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, worker-service, notification-service\n✅ **Correct report format**: Matches the expected JSON schema exactly\n✅ **Proper startup order**: auth-service → cache-service → api-gateway → worker-service → notification-service (dependencies first)\n✅ **Correct readiness score**: 1.0 with proper weighting (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n✅ **Correct overall status**: 'healthy' since all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95\n✅ **Critical services healthy**: true (only checking high-criticality services as required)\n✅ **All services healthy**: All endpoints responding correctly with HTTP 200\n\nAll the critical bugs have been fixed:\n- Fixed service loading to read from deployment.services\n- Fixed criticality weights to use correct values\n- Fixed startup order algorithm for proper topological sort\n- Fixed critical services check to only evaluate high-criticality services\n- Fixed readiness score calculation to include all services\n\nThe deployment health validation tool is now fully functional and ready for production use.",
