  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully debugged and fixed all critical issues in the deployment health validator:\n\n**Issues Fixed:**\n1. ✅ Service loading - Fixed to read from `deployment.services` instead of legacy `services`\n2. ✅ Criticality weights - Corrected to high=3, medium=2, low=1 for proper readiness scoring\n3. ✅ Startup order - Fixed topological sort algorithm so dependencies come first\n4. ✅ Critical services check - Fixed to only check high-criticality services, not all services\n5. ✅ Readiness score calculation - Fixed to include all services with proper weighting\n\n**Verification:**\n- All 5 production services are being checked (auth, api-gateway, cache, worker, notification)\n- Report format matches the exact JSON schema specified\n- Startup order is correct: auth → cache → api-gateway → worker → notification\n- Readiness score is 1.0 with correct weighted calculation\n- Overall status is 'healthy' as expected with all services up\n- Critical services healthy is true (only auth-service and api-gateway are high-criticality)\n\nThe validator now produces the correct deployment_report.json and all functionality works according to the requirements. The deployment pipeline validation tool is ready for production use.",
