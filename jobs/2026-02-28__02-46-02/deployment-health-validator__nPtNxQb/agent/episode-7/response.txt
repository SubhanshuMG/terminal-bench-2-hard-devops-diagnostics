  "analysis": "I can see several critical issues in the validator.py that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong service loading**: The `load_services` function reads from the top-level `services` list instead of `deployment.services` which contains the actual 5 services we need to validate.\n\n2. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score`, all weights are set to 1 instead of high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status`, it's checking ALL services instead of only high-criticality services for the critical_ok determination.\n\n4. **Dependency graph direction**: In `compute_startup_order`, the graph edges are backwards - dependencies should point TO the service, not FROM the service.\n\nLet me test the current broken version first, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll first test the current broken validator to see its output, then fix the issues one by one: correct service loading, fix criticality weights, fix critical services check, and fix dependency graph direction.",
