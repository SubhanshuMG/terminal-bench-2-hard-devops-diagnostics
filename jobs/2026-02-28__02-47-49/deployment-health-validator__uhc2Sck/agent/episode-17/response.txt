  "analysis": "There's a bug in the compute_startup_order function. The issue is that when building the dependency graph, it's adding dependencies to the wrong direction. The current code adds dependencies to the service's own graph entry, but it should be adding the service to the dependency's entry. Also, the in_degree calculation is incorrect.",
  "plan": "I need to fix the compute_startup_order function. The dependency graph building logic is backwards - when service A depends on B, B should point to A (indicating A depends on B), not the other way around. I need to fix the graph building and in_degree calculation.",
