  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is correctly generated and matches the expected schema. All the bugs have been fixed: 1) The YAML parsing now correctly reads from config['deployment']['services'], 2) The readiness score weights are correctly set (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) The critical services check only looks at high-criticality services, 4) The startup ordering correctly implements topological sorting. The report shows all services healthy with a readiness score of 1.0 and overall status 'healthy'. The task is complete.",
