  "analysis": "Let me double-check the startup order to make sure it's correct. Looking at the manifest, the dependencies are: auth-service (no deps), cache-service (no deps), api-gateway (depends on auth-service and cache-service), worker-service (depends on api-gateway and cache-service), notification-service (depends on worker-service). So the correct startup order should be: auth-service, cache-service, api-gateway, worker-service, notification-service. But the current output shows notification-service first, which seems backwards.",

For topological sorting, services with no dependencies should come first. Let me verify the logic is correct.",
