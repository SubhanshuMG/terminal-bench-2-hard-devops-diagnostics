  "analysis": "I can see the issue - the lines are mixed up. The current code has `graph[svc].append(dep)` and `in_degree[svc] += 1` which is wrong. For topological sorting, when service A depends on B, I need B to have in_degree 0 and A to have in_degree > 0. Let me fix this by replacing both lines correctly.",
