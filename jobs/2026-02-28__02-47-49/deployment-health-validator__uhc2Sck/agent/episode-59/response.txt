  "analysis": "Excellent! Now the startup order is correct. The order is: auth-service and cache-service first (they have no dependencies), then api-gateway (depends on both auth-service and cache-service), then worker-service (depends on api-gateway and cache-service), and finally notification-service (depends on worker-service).
