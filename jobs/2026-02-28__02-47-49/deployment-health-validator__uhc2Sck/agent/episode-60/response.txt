  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly. All the bugs have been fixed: 1) YAML parsing now correctly reads from config['deployment']['services'], 2) Readiness score weights are correctly set (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Critical services check only looks at high-criticality services, 4) Startup ordering correctly implements topological sorting with the proper dependency graph logic. The startup order is now correct: auth-service and cache-service (no dependencies) come first, followed by api-gateway, then worker-service, then notification-service. The readiness score is 1.0 and overall status is 'healthy'. The task is complete.",
