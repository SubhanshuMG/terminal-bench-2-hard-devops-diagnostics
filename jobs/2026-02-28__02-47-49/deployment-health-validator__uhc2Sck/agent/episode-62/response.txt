  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report is completely correct and matches the expected schema exactly. All fields are present and correct: deployment_name is 'production-stack', overall_status is 'healthy' (since all high-criticality services are healthy and readiness_score is 1.0 >= 0.95), readiness_score is 1.0, service_statuses contains all 5 services with correct status, http_status, and criticality, startup_order is correct with proper topological sorting, critical_services_healthy is true (all high-criticality services are healthy), and timestamp is in ISO format. All bugs have been successfully fixed.",
  "plan": "The deployment health validator is now fully functional and producing the correct output. All four main bugs have been fixed: YAML parsing, readiness score weights, critical services check, and startup ordering logic.",
