  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py code. The main problems are: 1) The `load_services` function is reading from the wrong part of the YAML - it's using `config['services']` which is the legacy monitoring section, but it should be using `config['deployment']['services']` for the authoritative deployment configuration. 2) The `compute_readiness_score` function has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1). 3) The `determine_status` function is checking all services instead of just high-criticality services for the critical_ok check. I also need to start the mock services.",
  "plan": "First, I'll start the mock services by running the mock_services.py script. Then I'll fix the three main bugs in validator.py: correct the YAML parsing path, fix the readiness score weights, and fix the critical services check.",
