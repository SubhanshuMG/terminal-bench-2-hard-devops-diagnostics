All fields are present and correct: deployment_name, overall_status ('healthy'), readiness_score (1.0), service_statuses with all 5 services showing healthy status and correct criticality levels, startup_order with proper topological sorting, critical_services_healthy (true), and timestamp. The validator is now working correctly.",
  "plan": "Let me test the validator with a scenario where some services might be unhealthy to verify the logic works correctly in different scenarios. I'll check if there's a way to simulate service failures or test edge cases.",
