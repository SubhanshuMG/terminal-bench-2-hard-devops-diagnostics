  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the broken deployment health validator. The validator.py script now correctly:\n\n1. Loads the deployment services from config['deployment']['services'] instead of the legacy services\n2. Applies correct criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) for readiness score calculation\n3. Uses proper topological sort direction so dependencies start before dependent services\n4. Only checks high-criticality services for the critical_services_healthy flag\n5. Generates a deployment report at /app/deployment_report.json with the correct schema\n\nAll mock services are running and responding correctly, and the validator produces the expected output with proper service health checks, topological ordering, and overall status determination.",
