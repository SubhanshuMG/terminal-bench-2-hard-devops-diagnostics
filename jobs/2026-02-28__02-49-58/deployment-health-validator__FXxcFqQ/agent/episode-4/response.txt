  "analysis": "As expected, the script is broken and only processing the legacy 'metrics-collector' service instead of the actual deployment services. The script is trying to check the metrics-collector service which isn't running, hence the HTTP 0 status. Now I need to fix the script to properly load the deployment services and fix the other issues I identified.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py script by addressing the four main issues: 1) Correct the service loading to use deployment.services instead of services, 2) Fix the criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fix the dependency graph direction for proper topological sort, 4) Fix the critical services check to only check high-criticality services.",
