I need to start by examining the current state of the files and understanding the problem. Let me first look at the deployment manifest to understand the services and their configurations.

{
  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory and need to understand the current state of the deployment health validation tool. I need to examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the services, their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. Then I'll look at the broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configurations. Then I'll look at the current validator.py to see what's broken. After that, I'll check if the mock services are running and test their health endpoints to understand the expected behavior.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la /app/\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
