  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working correctly. All services are healthy (even though worker-service returns 'degraded' in its JSON response, it's still returning HTTP 200 so it's considered healthy). The startup order is correct (auth-service and cache-service first since they have no dependencies, then api-gateway which depends on both, then worker-service which depends on api-gateway and cache-service, finally notification-service which depends on worker-service). The readiness score is 1.0 (100%) since all services are healthy, and the overall status is 'healthy' as expected.",
