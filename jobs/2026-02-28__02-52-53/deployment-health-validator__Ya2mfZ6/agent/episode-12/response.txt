  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment report has been generated correctly and matches the expected schema exactly. All the key components are working:\n\n1. **Service loading**: Now correctly loads from 'deployment.services' instead of the top-level 'services'\n2. **Health checks**: All services are responding correctly (HTTP 200)\n3. **Startup order**: Correctly topologically sorted - dependencies come before dependents\n4. **Readiness score**: Correctly calculated as 1.0 (100%) with proper weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. **Overall status**: 'healthy' because all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95\n6. **Critical services healthy**: true because both high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy\n\nThe validator is now working correctly and ready for production use.",
