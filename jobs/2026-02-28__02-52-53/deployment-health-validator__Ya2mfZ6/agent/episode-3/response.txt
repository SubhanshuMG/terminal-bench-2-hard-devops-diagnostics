  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py script:\n\n1. **Wrong service loading**: The `load_services()` function is loading from the top-level 'services' key instead of 'deployment.services' which contains the actual 5 services we need to validate.\n\n2. **Incorrect criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all criticality levels are mapped to weight 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Topological sort direction**: In `compute_startup_order()`, the graph construction is backwards - it's adding dependencies as children instead of parents, which will give the wrong startup order.\n\n4. **Critical services logic**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality services.\n\nLet me also test the mock services to see their current status.",
  "plan": "First, I'll test the mock services to see their current health status. Then I'll fix the validator.py script by addressing the issues I identified: correct service loading, fix criticality weights, fix topological sort, and fix critical services logic.",
