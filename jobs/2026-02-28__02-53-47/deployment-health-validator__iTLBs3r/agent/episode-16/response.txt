  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is working perfectly in both scenarios. In the failure case, it correctly shows all services as unhealthy, sets the overall_status to 'critical' (because high-criticality services are unhealthy), sets readiness_score to 0.0, and sets critical_services_healthy to false. Let me restart the mock services and run one final test to confirm everything is working correctly.",
