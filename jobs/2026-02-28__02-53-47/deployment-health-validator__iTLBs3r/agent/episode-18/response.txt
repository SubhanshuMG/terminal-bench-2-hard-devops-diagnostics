  "analysis": "Perfect! The deployment health validator has been successfully fixed and is working correctly. The validator now:\n\n1. ✅ Correctly loads all 5 services from the deployment.services section (not the legacy services section)\n2. ✅ Properly checks health of all services with correct HTTP status codes\n3. ✅ Generates the correct startup order using topological sorting (auth-service -> cache-service -> api-gateway -> worker-service -> notification-service)\n4. ✅ Computes the readiness score with correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n5. ✅ Sets the overall_status correctly based on the requirements (healthy when all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95)\n6. ✅ Generates the deployment_report.json with the correct schema including all required fields\n7. ✅ Properly handles failure scenarios (detects unhealthy services and sets appropriate status)\n\nThe validator is now producing the expected output with all services healthy, readiness_score of 1.0, and overall_status of 'healthy'.",
