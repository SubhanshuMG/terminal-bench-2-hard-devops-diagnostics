  "analysis": "I can see several issues in the validator.py script that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Critical Issue**: The `load_services()` function is loading from the wrong section of the manifest. It's loading from the top-level 'services' list (which only has the metrics-collector legacy service), but it should load from 'deployment.services' which contains all 5 services.\n\n2. **Critical Issue**: In the `compute_readiness_score()` function, the weight_map has all weights set to 1, but according to the requirements, it should be: high=3, medium=2, low=1.\n\n3. **Critical Issue**: In the `determine_status()` function, the critical_ok check is looking at ALL services instead of only high-criticality services.\n\n4. **Minor Issue**: The `compute_startup_order()` function has the dependency graph built incorrectly - it's adding dependencies as if they're incoming edges rather than outgoing edges.\n\nLet me test the current broken script first to confirm it's not working, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "I'll first run the current broken script to see the output, then fix the issues one by one. The main fixes needed are: correct the manifest loading path, fix the readiness score weights, fix the critical services check, and fix the startup order algorithm.",
