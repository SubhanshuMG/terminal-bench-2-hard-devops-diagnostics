  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues. The script is only loading the 'metrics-collector' service from the legacy top-level 'services' section instead of the 5 production services from 'deployment.services'. The readiness score is 0 because the weight_map is incorrect, and the overall status is 'critical' because it's checking all services instead of just high-criticality ones.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py script by: 1) Correcting the load_services function to load from 'deployment.services', 2) Fixing the weight_map in compute_readiness_score to use the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixing the determine_status function to only check high-criticality services for critical_ok, and 4) Fixing the startup order algorithm.",
