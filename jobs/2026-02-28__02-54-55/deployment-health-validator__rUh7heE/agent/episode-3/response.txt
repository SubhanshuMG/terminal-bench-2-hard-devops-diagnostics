  "analysis": "I've identified several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. The `load_services` function is reading from the wrong section of the YAML file - it's using `config[\"services\"]` which is the legacy monitoring section, not the authoritative deployment configuration which should be `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`.\n\n2. The `weight_map` in `compute_readiness_score` has all weights set to 1 instead of the correct weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. The `determine_status` function is checking if ALL services are healthy instead of just the high-criticality services for the `critical_ok` check.\n\n4. The topological sort in `compute_startup_order` has the graph edges reversed - dependencies should point to dependents, but the current code has dependents pointing to dependencies.\n\nLet me test the current broken version first to confirm the issues, then fix them.",
