  "analysis": "Perfect! The current validator is indeed broken as expected. It's only checking the 'metrics-collector' service from the legacy monitoring section instead of the 5 services in the deployment configuration. The score is 0.0 and it's not checking any of the actual service endpoints. Now I need to fix the identified issues.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by:\n1. Fixing the load_services function to use the correct YAML path\n2. Fixing the weight_map to use correct weights (3,2,1)\n3. Fixing the determine_status function to only check high-criticality services\n4. Fixing the topological sort direction in compute_startup_order",
