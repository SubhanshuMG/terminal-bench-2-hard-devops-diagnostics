  "analysis": "I'm starting in the /app directory where the deployment health validation tool is located. I can see the task description indicates there are three key files: deployment_manifest.yaml, mock_services.py (already running), and a broken validator.py that needs to be fixed. I need to first examine the current state of these files to understand what needs to be fixed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll list the contents of the /app directory to confirm the files are present. Then I'll examine the deployment_manifest.yaml to understand the service configuration, check if the mock services are actually running, and then look at the current broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
