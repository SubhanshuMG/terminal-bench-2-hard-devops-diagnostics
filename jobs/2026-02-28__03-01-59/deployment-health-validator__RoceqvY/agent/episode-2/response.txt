  "analysis": "Perfect! I can see the deployment manifest clearly defines 5 services with their ports, health endpoints, dependencies, and criticality levels. The services are: auth-service (port 8081, /health, high), api-gateway (port 8082, /health, high, depends on auth-service and cache-service), cache-service (port 8083, /ping, medium), worker-service (port 8084, /status, low, depends on api-gateway and cache-service), and notification-service (port 8085, /health, low, depends on worker-service). Now I need to check if the mock services are actually running.",
  "plan": "I'll test if the mock services are running by trying to access one of the health endpoints, then examine the current broken validator.py to understand what needs to be fixed.",
