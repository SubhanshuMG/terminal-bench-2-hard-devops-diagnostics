  "analysis": "Excellent! The validator is now working perfectly. All 5 services are being detected and reported as healthy, the readiness score is correctly calculated as 1.0 (100%), the startup order is correct with dependencies first, and the overall status is 'healthy'. The deployment report is being generated correctly at /app/deployment_report.json with the proper schema. The validator has been successfully fixed.",
  "plan": "The task is now complete. The validator.py has been successfully fixed to:\n1. Load services from the correct 'deployment.services' section of the manifest\n2. Use correct criticality weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1) for readiness score calculation\n3. Only check high-criticality services for the critical_services_healthy flag\n4. Correctly handle dependency graph direction for proper startup ordering\n5. Handle different health endpoint response formats correctly",
