  "analysis": "Yes, I am confident the task is complete. I have successfully fixed the broken validator.py by addressing all the critical issues:\n\n1. ✅ Fixed service loading - now loads from 'deployment.services' instead of 'services'\n2. ✅ Fixed criticality weights - now uses high=3, medium=2, low=1 for readiness score calculation\n3. ✅ Fixed critical services check - now only checks high-criticality services for critical_services_healthy\n4. ✅ Fixed dependency graph direction - dependencies now correctly come before dependents in startup order\n5. ✅ Improved health check logic - handles different response formats (JSON with 'status' or 'health_status', plain text 'pong')\n\nThe validator now correctly:\n- Detects all 5 services (auth-service, api-gateway, cache-service, worker-service, notification-service)\n- Reports them all as healthy with correct HTTP status codes\n- Generates correct startup order (dependencies first)\n- Calculates readiness score of 1.0 (100%) with proper weighting\n- Sets overall_status to 'healthy' since all high-criticality services are healthy and score >= 0.95\n- Generates proper JSON report at /app/deployment_report.json matching the expected schema\n\nThe deployment health validation tool is now working correctly and ready for the deployment pipeline.",
