  "analysis": "I've examined the validator.py code and identified several critical issues that need to be fixed:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The `load_services()` function loads from the top-level 'services' list instead of the authoritative 'deployment.services' section\n2. **Incorrect criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all weights are set to 1 instead of the specified weights (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. **Incorrect critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking all services instead of only high-criticality services\n4. **Health check logic issues**: The health check logic may not work correctly with different response formats\n5. **Startup order dependency mapping**: The dependency graph construction appears to have the direction reversed\n\nThese issues would cause the validator to not work correctly according to the specifications.",
  "plan": "I'll run the current broken validator to see what output it produces, then fix each of the identified issues one by one. The main fixes needed are: correct service loading, correct weight mapping, correct critical services checking, and dependency graph direction.",
