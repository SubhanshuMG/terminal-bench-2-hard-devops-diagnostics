  "analysis": "Perfect! This confirms the issues I identified. The validator is only loading the top-level 'services' list which only contains 'metrics-collector', not the authoritative 'deployment.services' section. This is why it's only seeing one service instead of all five services. Now I need to fix the validator.py code to address all the identified issues.",
  "plan": "I'll fix the validator.py by making the following key changes:\n1. Fix `load_services()` to load from 'deployment.services' instead of 'services'\n2. Fix the criticality weights in `compute_readiness_score()` (high=3, medium=2, low=1)\n3. Fix `determine_status()` to check only high-criticality services for the critical_ok check\n4. Fix the dependency graph direction in `compute_startup_order()`\n5. Improve the health check logic to handle different response formats correctly",
