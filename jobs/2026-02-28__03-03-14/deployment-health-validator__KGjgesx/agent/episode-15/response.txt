  "analysis": "I found an issue! The validator is treating 'degraded' as healthy when it should be treating it as unhealthy. The problem is in the health check logic - it's using `body.get(\"health_status\", \"ok\")` but the worker-service response doesn't have a \"health_status\" field, so it defaults to \"ok\". Let me check the actual response format and fix this.",
