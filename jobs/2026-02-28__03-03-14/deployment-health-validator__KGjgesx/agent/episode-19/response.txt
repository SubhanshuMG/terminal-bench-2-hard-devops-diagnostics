  "analysis": "Perfect! The validator is now working correctly and the task is complete. Let me verify the key fixes are working:\n\n1. ✅ **Correct services loaded**: The validator now loads from `config['deployment']['services']` instead of the legacy services\n2. ✅ **Correct criticality weights**: high=3, medium=2, low=1 are properly applied\n3. ✅ **Correct topological sort**: Dependencies come before dependents in startup order\n4. ✅ **Correct critical services check**: Only high-criticality services are checked for critical status\n5. ✅ **Correct health parsing**: Uses `body.get(\"status\")` instead of `body.get(\"health_status\")`\n\nThe readiness score calculation is correct: (3+3+2+1) healthy out of (3+3+2+1+1) total = 9/10 = 0.9\nThe overall status is 'degraded' because all high-criticality services are healthy but score < 0.95",
