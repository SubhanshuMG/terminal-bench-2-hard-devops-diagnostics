  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the deployment health validator. Let me summarize what was accomplished:\n\n**Issues Fixed:**\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: Changed `config[\"services\"]` to `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]` to load the authoritative deployment services instead of legacy monitoring services\n2. **Incorrect criticality weights**: Fixed weights from all 1s to high=3, medium=2, low=1\n3. **Incorrect topological sort**: Fixed the dependency direction so dependencies come before dependents in startup order\n4. **Wrong critical services check**: Changed to only check high-criticality services instead of all services\n5. **Incorrect health parsing**: Fixed to use `body.get(\"status\")` instead of `body.get(\"health_status\")`\n\n**Verification:**\n- All 5 services are properly detected and health-checked\n- Readiness score calculation is correct (weighted based on criticality)\n- Startup order is topologically correct\n- Overall status logic works properly (healthy/degraded/critical/not_ready)\n- Report schema matches the expected format exactly\n- The validator correctly handles both healthy and unhealthy services\n\nThe validator now produces correct deployment reports and the deployment pipeline should work properly.",
