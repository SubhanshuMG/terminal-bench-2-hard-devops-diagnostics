  "analysis": "I found several critical issues in the validator.py:\n\n1. **Wrong services loaded**: The script loads `config[\"services\"]` which gets the legacy monitoring services, not the authoritative deployment services from `config[\"deployment\"][\"services\"]`.\n\n2. **Wrong criticality weights**: In `compute_readiness_score()`, all weights are set to 1 instead of the correct values (high=3, medium=2, low=1).\n\n3. **Incorrect startup order logic**: The topological sort has the dependency direction reversed - it should put dependencies BEFORE their dependents, but the current code does the opposite.\n\n4. **Wrong critical services check**: In `determine_status()`, it's checking ALL services instead of just HIGH-criticality services.\n\nLet me first verify the mock services are running, then fix these issues.",
  "plan": "First, I'll verify that the mock services are actually running by testing a couple of endpoints. Then I'll fix the validator.py by correcting the four issues I identified.",
