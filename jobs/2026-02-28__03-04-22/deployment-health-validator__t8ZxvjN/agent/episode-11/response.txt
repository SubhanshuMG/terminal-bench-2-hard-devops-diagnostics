  "analysis": "I can see several issues with the validator.py file. The main problems are: 1) It's loading services from the wrong section of the manifest (top-level 'services' instead of 'deployment.services'), 2) The weight mapping for readiness score calculation is wrong (all set to 1), 3) The critical services check is checking all services instead of just high-criticality ones, and 4) The health check logic for determining healthy/unhealthy status needs to be aligned with the actual service responses.",
  "plan": "I'll fix these issues one by one: 1) Fix the manifest loading to use deployment.services, 2) Fix the weight mapping to use high=3, medium=2, low=1, 3) Fix the critical services check to only check high-criticality services, 4) Adjust the health check logic to properly handle the different response formats.",
