  "analysis": "Good! I've successfully updated the validator.py file with the fixes. The key changes made are: 1) Fixed manifest loading to use deployment.services instead of top-level services, 2) Fixed weight mapping for readiness score (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixed critical services check to only check high-criticality services, 4) Added special handling for cache-service's plain text response, and 5) Fixed the topological sort algorithm to properly handle dependencies. Now let me test the validator to see if it works correctly.",
  "plan": "I'll run the validator to test if the fixes work correctly and generate the expected deployment report.",
