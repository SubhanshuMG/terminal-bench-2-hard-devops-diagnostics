  "analysis": "Perfect! The manual verification confirms that the readiness score calculation is correct. With 4 out of 5 services healthy (worker-service is unhealthy), the score is 0.9, which matches our calculation. All high-criticality services (auth-service and api-gateway) are healthy, so critical_services_healthy is true, and since the score is 0.9 (between 0.70 and 0.95), the overall status is correctly identified as 'degraded'. The validator is now working correctly.",
