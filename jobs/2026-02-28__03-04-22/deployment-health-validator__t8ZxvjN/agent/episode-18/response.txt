  "analysis": "The validator is working perfectly and consistently. Let me verify the topological ordering is correct by checking against the dependencies in the manifest: auth-service and cache-service have no dependencies, api-gateway depends on both auth-service and cache-service, worker-service depends on api-gateway and cache-service, and notification-service depends on worker-service. The startup order [auth-service, cache-service, api-gateway, worker-service, notification-service] correctly places dependencies before their dependents.",
  "plan": "The task is complete. The validator has been successfully fixed with all the required corrections: proper manifest loading, correct health checks for different response formats, accurate readiness score calculation with proper weights, correct topological startup ordering, and proper overall status determination based on the specified rules.",
