  "analysis": "I have successfully fixed the broken validator.py script. The key fixes implemented were: 1) Fixed manifest loading to use deployment.services instead of the top-level services, 2) Corrected the weight mapping for readiness score calculation (high=3, medium=2, low=1), 3) Fixed the critical services check to only validate high-criticality services, 4) Added proper handling for cache-service's plain text 'pong' response, 5) Fixed the topological sort algorithm to correctly handle dependencies, and 6) Corrected the overall status determination logic. The validator now produces the expected JSON output at /app/deployment_report.json with all required fields and proper values.",
  "plan": "The task is complete. The validator is working correctly and generating the proper deployment health report with the correct schema, readiness score calculation, topological startup ordering, and overall status determination according to the specified rules.",
